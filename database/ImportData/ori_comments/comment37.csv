"I had a massage by Chelsea and the service was not relaxing or good. She clearly massaged over knots that needed to be worked out. She breathed heavy the whole time which made me feel uncomfortable. I could hear people talking through the walls. I also asked for my back and feet to be worked on only and somehow ended up with a full body massage. I would not recommend this place because there are too many other options in the area that are way better. Massage Heights would be a better bet.","2016-07-24","0","YT--S47-0A68dP-Fw-bT-A","ATwrhfrILU48_siKGdvkAA"

"I just ate the best brisket sandwich ever. I'm a serious BBQ snob and finding this place in Phoenix I was skeptical. The brisket was perfect. Smoky and blackened on the ends and yet tender and juicy, seriously they give you sauce but I didn't want to ruin it. The bun was amazing and toasted with butter. I waited about ten minutes in line but it was worth it. The staff are super friendly and the venue is pretty cool. Highly recommend this place!!","2017-05-16","0","VtgFuz3LXsrGB-SzPSQbDg","iOIznOBI_pl8Wye614_hbw"

"I've been looking for a good salon\/spa where I can feel comfortable and is sanitary. Finally found this where I can have a Brazilian Wax again next month. The lady is nice and she does not reuse the applicator unlike other places I've been to. She is also thorough in doing the waxing and does not rush it. The regular prices are very reasonable to which I don't mind paying, $24 for a BW compared to $45 to $60 from others. I recommend checking this place out!","2015-07-09","0","LNsD1ZHQkHkfNGb2tD-jQg","I-fIFc5_uXwmYP80IvOJ1Q"

"You would think staying here would allow you to go to the lounge and take a couple bottles of water for the room or to stroll the strip. But apparently because we had a family of 6, we were told to ""keep the distance from drinks"" when a couple nearby filled their gym bag full of drinks about the same amount as our family of 6 when they were just 2 people.

"I came here faithfully until the change of ownership. I stopped coming after one of the employees offered to ""give me free"" sessions after I had exhausted my package in exchange for a minimum fee. So, I attribute the new owners behavior to her frustration with trying to comprehend why the numbers are t adding up. So, in her defense I will say it's true Employees  were stealing money from her.

"I have been coming to LA tan for close to two years and became a member about 8 months ago. After going to other salons, I am very satisfied here. The equipment is top notch and unlike other places I have never gotten a burn and the tan is always perfect. Most of the staff are pleasant but in particular I have to say Sara is the best! She is very pleasant, always  remembers who I am and greets me with a smile. She is a pleasure to deal with and makes you feel like coming back !","2016-10-31","0","qXpvy10lWZuQZcFMhJZ8Rg","9b21fjpV5yHkTJdH22yXzQ"

I tried the kafta platter and the chicken on the grill, it was delicious, the flavor was bursting all over. Their fattoush is also really good, more organization is needed definitely in the restaurant, between the staff but I recommend this place to anyone staying at the hotels beside this resto.","2015-11-01","0","aCNiO3KPX-nB2vdSRFjxdQ","ezEss_lT9REaX9_J0RZZag"

My current favorite is the Chicken Philly. While its not on the menu, they'll make it up for ya! And their ranch is homemade, which is a deal breaker if I get fries at most places. 
Would highly recommend!","2015-09-24","0","rHahPokF4Ne2yaI4lNKxPQ","paUSp0C8ZpnFdXs0FCq5wA"

"Horrible place to visit. We ordered 3 w\/ 1 being the mushroom & vegetable sizzler w\/ Schezuan sauce. The mushroom & vegetable sizzler came w\/ no mushrooms. When we told the server, she just got us some mushrooms on the side & said here you go. The owner didn't even apologize. He was convincing us dat we didn't miss out on anything. Y should I pay $20 for something which is not even half of what I ordered? Also too much sauce on the food making it difficult to taste anything else. Waste of money.","2015-12-28","0","lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw","WSfooHvv7T2LzhdazOucLw"

"War heute schon wieder im Grünen Michel ....immer wieder ein Genuss . Ich konnte draußen sitzen , bekam ein tolles Mittagsessen und eine spritzige Soda Holunder - serviert vom Chef persönlich . Auch die Bedienung am Mittag mit ihrem offenen freundlichen und zugewandten Gesicht war angenehm - ich liebe dieses Restaurant !","2016-08-19","0","Di5QdSiP0Kd20abQvRSiTw","mHqroxeDrncDqZGBA74WHw"
"Ja , so ist es , Mut und Qualität wird belohnt . Nun habe ich auch den oberen  Raum im Michel kennen gelernt , sehr geeignet für kleine und mittlere Veranstaltungen . Und er ist ebenso liebevoll dekoriert und eingerichtet , wie unten ,hier ist bedeutend mehr Platz für Tische und Menschen . Ich bin wieder am köstlichen Jim Knopf Burger hängen geblieben ( er könnte einen Tick wärmer sein ) mit den super - leckeren Süßkartoffel Frites und einem Salat Schüsselchen . Schmeckt nach mehr !! Bis bald !","2016-08-11","0","Di5QdSiP0Kd20abQvRSiTw","mHqroxeDrncDqZGBA74WHw"

Not to say it couldn't happen in the future but with the incredible heat this summer and rain storms we still have not seen one.

"We had the extensive treatment where the inside and  the outside of the house were sealed. It was not cheap but it was an all day job for two men and appears to have been well worth it. We have not had a scorpion or other critter for at least 6 weeks, not even with the heavy rains. So far, so good.

"Dear owner of India Bowel, 

Please reopen! This is the ONLY decent Indian Restaurant in Las Vegas that I would actually dine at and I believe other would too. I was so disappointed I could not find your restaurant anymore. Your food is authentic, not commercial, with appropriate spices and the food was made fresh. Please return to the restaurant or food truck scene.

Server finally came and said he'd check if the kitchen will still serve me food because kitchen closes at 11 when restaurant closes at midnight. That makes sense!Obviously didn't want to be served so I just said forget it and left. As a server myself, I've never heard that before. Correct me if I'm wrong. At least make it clear what time the restaurant closes. I would've been out of there before 12!","2016-01-20","0","44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ","RpyB9LqaBUShWFMRocasfw"

Their hummus is fresh and homemade, their Mac and cheese bites (along with their fries and fried veggies) are crispy and super hot.. Everything is made fresh to order.

"Up date to my review: We arrived a full 40 minutes prior to our showtime and the first snag we encountered was that the tix we purchased yesterday were issued for the wrong time, so it took 10 minutes to straighten that out. Then, on a very busy Sunday, loaded with kids, they had only 2 concession lines open, both long lines and slow service. Barely made it to our theater on time. Good thing the seats are reserved!
Tip: arrive PLENTY early!","2016-07-24","0","PTtBAaY1GgH929EjdlYLiA","2JQQPOEdIjx7jOCn55pcvA"

"We really like this place because it's close to home and reasonably priced. However, the past few times we've been here, it's been filthy. It didn't even appear they clean in between movies. Chocolate all over the seats, soda machines not working, and the self serve butter station is beyond disgusting. Takes away from the fairly recent renovation with the declining seats.","2017-11-21","0","PTtBAaY1GgH929EjdlYLiA","jIMbS8fzENrs2XL-AfScfA"

"Happened on Nani quite by accident, and what a happy accident it was!  They share a parking lot with the Americinn.

We have enjoyed dim sum in Hong Kong, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, etc., and Nani was as delicious, fresh and tasty as the best that we have had anywhere.

We especially enjoyed the shrimp dumplings, sticky rice steamed in lotus leaves, shrimp crepes and fried crab and seaweed.  I am a fan of tripe and theirs is delicious.

"We returned to what is now my favorite coffee shop in Las Vegas. Joseph described for us a new concoction he created called the Walter White (you have to have seen Breaking Bad to appreciate the namesake). If yo want the perfect espresso drink to get you going or keep you going, give this deliciously invigorating drink a try. Espresso with a touch of Carmel and a hint of chocolate rounded off with a little cream, this drink is divine.  For other adventures, check out this little gem of a cafe.","2015-11-28","0","Vbal-AZnu2w6NttIKfdjDg","e4uyqSXaYcjq8bCUowMFkA"

"The Bloody Mary bar is well worth it! Stuff as much on there as you can and its amazing. 

If you order the chicken and waffles, it's delicious but be prepared for the fried leeks. They're super tasty and I loved them but my boyfriend thought they were a tiny by over powering, so I ate half of his toppings. The waffle though is cooked perfectly. Perfect crispy, fluffiness you want in a waffle. 

Scrambles are ok. They're just eggs mixed with stuff but if that's your thing, then they are good.","2016-01-11","0","Yl05MqCs9xRzrJFkGWLpgA","SPFHjf2GtTWTqJz_Ngnwgg"

"Awesome atmosphere, good drinks, but the food is mediocre at best. The wait was long (probably because it's still new). The service was slow. They quoted us 1.5 hours on a Thursday evening. When we got seated, it took more than 15 mins for our server to get to us.  For what it is, it's incredibly overpriced. I'd much rather get good quality food from a local business, but it'd be a cool place to go for a night out - their drinks are pretty strong.","2017-07-13","0","TaEASKZil0TT7CAzyqFUgw","og-vD9plC5tinlV74Ohndg"

First comment was no sauerkraut on hot dogs how dare they. Next thing I noticed when we got into the restaurant were herded in as cattle and then I paid to much. Double a hamburger tasted very bland. The fries were very salty I could taste the salt before the fries and hamburgers. I taste the condiments before the hamburger.","2013-11-24","0","6t7mlTVjDA9fhuFAZmVzAQ","gS_FgHvJ3O8oUA4qD2dDaA"

If you are caught off guard you will walk out with a huge bill, non-refundable purchase and no way to contact anyone about it.

"Very unprofessional!! The amount of dogs they board and ""train"" does not add up to the amount of trainers. Willy told me he spend 10 mins a day with each dog(...if that) I'm not ok with my dog spending the majority of the day in a kennel. Especially if I'm paying over 1000$! Everything seemed really good until I paid, then my phone calls and texts stoped being answered.

"Couldn't have executed a better second location. This beer is unmatched, and will consistently blow your mind. 

The pizza holds up to fate north and they did a great job with the rest of the menu. Try the roasted grape salad and make sure you get a taste of the hot oil aioli. Still have never had a better beer cheese and pretzel. 

Just an all around fantastic spot to spend your time drinking incredible beer and delicious food. Do yourself a favor and just go there, often.

I never would've pictured those three ingredients going together, but this stuff was amazing! Every morsel - delicious! The beer-what can I say...Hefeweizen - delicious and he had the Irish red.

I was greeted with a warm welcome and explained the details of the menu. It was nice being educated on the menu because I wasn't left standing with no guidance. The food was great. I did the combo and thought it was a great value for your buck. The half sandwich size was above average & the chicken curry soup was better than expected.

"Ordered 6 items 4 fried in the same batter and over fried... Blue crab was more like no crab and the Crawfish poor boy needs less bread (never thought those words would ever come out of my mouth). Portions were huge, fries were great. Potato salad rocked.
It wasn't bad it just wasn't something I'll crave in the future.... But maybe I just need someone to tell me what's the best. 
Ps- if you order to go make sure you have crab crackers at home.","2015-09-18","0","poSV39UqEg-gpESXafS9-g","Sz4N01C2R3JCKU4cznr2Zw"

What ever it was it wasn't good..."" And it's true.  The food quality has gone way down, there is no connection to the staff because of front counter order and pay.  I hope you go back to being a restaurant and loose the take out model.  I don't know who the cook is related to, but these changes are killing your business!","2014-09-25","0","-YR7K3rw6VAQ1-MjslvsoQ","wxpxFlTMsYPPRbuFkDxhZA"

Instead we received terrible service and were turned away at 9pm!! Note- people were still inside eating and there was still food on the line. They have a terrible rating anyway which we sadly failed to check out before- I wish we had check because it would have saved us quite the hassle.","2016-07-16","0","0odAupWjDV8gwhaLqyh1-A","D2DQvXzLFTi-MJBtvgx0tA"

Also convenient to us here in the southwest area, dont need to drive all the way to chinatown anymore for a korean fix!","2016-02-03","0","HUwzarG0givckxXWTF5lIQ","Nfrpu6ydonzM7c0irhsL7g"

"Really friendly administration and medical staff. 

I walked into Rollcare needing some attention and was tired of the walk in clinic close to my place. Things that impressed me the most:

- really short wait times during my visits. First visit was 15 minutes. 2nd visit was 8-10 minutes
- friendly and attentive staff
- kid friendly. I don't have kids but I noticed that some other patients were there with kids who were busy with kiddy books and activities. 
- pharmacy inside

Will go again!!","2016-09-14","0","FAxVAuOtEgzh3KbFxfTlMA","AuLF2KFzSQ_K8WXdzV2irw"

"This place was sketchy AF!

Called a week ahead to book a couples massage and they asked if I wanted the same room so I said ""it's a couples massage, so yes.."" weird question.

It wasn't until we got there, paid, and were being shown to our room that they said ""the couples room wasn't available and we had to use different rooms.""

Well.. one of those rooms was basically a bed in a closet under a staircase.. sheets hadn't been washed in idk how  long. Massage wasn't great either.

Don't reccomend","2016-03-01","0","6B72pzt1Jy6rGqqu_pkMsA","GKqOeBM8XSqG7HfdQCDLLw"

"The ice cream is NOT GOOD. It melts so fast, while you are eating it you are creating a mess! You need a lot of tissue and one cup when you eat the ice cream. Ok, I get they're business idea of making an unique ice cream, but they are trying too hard.The ice cream just full of sugar and cream. When you are eating your hands are sticky, it's so easy to drip on your shirt, and you just don't feel good.  just because it's all over Instagram and Twitter, doesn't mean it's good.","2015-09-22","0","N_2yEZ41g9zDW_gWArFiHw","sgLcwunZZNZgdprC9FJwKA"

"Flock & Fowl has been serving the hungry chicken masses for near two years out of a humble 8 table restaurant. Recently featured in USA Today, Food & Wine Magazine, and the Las Vegas RJ, the restaurant can be quite busy mid-shift, so arriving closer to opening or after 2PM will yield a much higher success for parties larger than 4 getting sat and fed quickly. Typically, all ordering happens at register with the entire party arrived and ready to be fed. New larger location expected by year's end.","2017-07-07","0","68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw","b3cssGUI0x0w12L7yM1yLw"

During this visit we ordered Leroy's chicken and waffles as well as the special called the""mother clucker"". Both dishes filled our bellies and created huge smiles on our faces. Food is on point and the service was too. Made us feel right at home. Definitely going back to try out the other items on the menu.","2015-10-31","0","VwdnJPb5WG8lM_whsZasHw","XjXl3N26otK4gtWhcSuL1w"

"Let's start by I needed a bigger vehicle for my family of 5. So I went to Car Guru.com they sent to this Johnny legends. They had a suburban and that was the type I was looking for. So I went there to see if I can get it or not so they got all of the information from me and my wife. Then the next day they wanted me and my wife to come down. So after work we went their just to find out that we was not approved to get the vehicle.  I will recommend this place to get a vehicle.","2017-08-04","0","Ch_iMphfKLaWbBdzbtc3Ow","w_ncKCr935xzTD9EkF_2gg"

"Always nervous about ordering Indian food. I'm originally from England where Indian food is everywhere and the standards are high because of the competition. After 26 year's in Vegas I've finally found my home away from home. My favorite is lamb vindaloo, hard to do, but when it's right it's amazing. This dish took me home, right about of heat, potatoes and lamb. Looking forward to my next visit.

"The sign ""Pizza"" doesn't do this place justice. Antonio's has an amazing quality in his ingredients, I've had Magiano's, and they must be getting their ingredients from the same places. Strongly recommend the Abtonio's signature pizza, dont just get a slice, youll want to eat the entire thing. Its always oven fresh, so let it sit for about 5 minutes, the juicy chicken and perfectly ripe tomatoes need a moment to cool. I dont know how he gets the toppings to be so hot, but keep their consistency.","2015-10-15","0","a2aIe4d-d7wUtkWsnIiEVQ","mYWYVoQwR4BEhDoh9b8pEA"

I ended up not wanting to have my tattoo done here at all!","2016-05-16","0","CFK5LNHU25PogQemIdsOKw","wnZH3npBWi42zxt7BUOPhg"

"Not worth it, please don't go, this is my honest review

***SMELL IT BEFORE YOU EAT***

We came and ordered South Indian thali, they gave spoiled subjee and  has bad smell, it's clearly smell like it's gone, but the reply from them this recipe is like that.

Another family also ordered and they also suspected but the reply is the same 

They are not accepting their mistake and they are defending, this was the worst experience I had

"If you're not in the 'in' crowd you will not be comfortable here.  The menu is very limited (appetizers are tuna-heavy)  and the service is spotty at best. The 'deli' case is distracting and seems out of place. The acoustics also do not lend to intimate conversation as they blast obnoxious music. The management should take a page from Mangiafoco's book and learn to better their customer service.

We ordered thinly sliced lamb, five spice beef, chicken, tofu and vegetables for our first course. We ordered Ramen and udon  for our second course. We were offered dessert but were  too full. Based on this experience, I would definitely go back and will try hot pot again. Pay with  cash for 10% off.","2016-05-25","0","L_tieGcFMQVSmk7XiA093A","auE-K0V0zGid16wD3Dd03Q"

"1. There was a piece of hair in the rice... With the follicle intact
 
2. It took about 15 mins to make my dish because, they ""never"" got my order (even though it showed on the same receipt)

3. The employee refused a customer of a hot cup of water. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is illegal to refuse someone of a cup of hot water. The customer came back to purchase water afterwards

"Finally had the opportunity to visit. We were a party of 10 on a Sunday afternoon. The pizza looked great when it arrived. The anticipation was high but the results were bland.  The crust on the Chicago classic tasted like a dry saltine cracker.  The sauce was nothing spectacular.  The thin crust sausage was better but still nothing great. Sorry Lou disappointed with your pizza.","2017-10-31","0","N8uKQ5Vdb1LAh-qXT_25Rg","c5uSmULn-X5XchbSyOoxlg"

"Don't order the Piccata. It is not piccata in any sense of the word. Also, don't come here if u are a woman dining alone or ""look"" like you won't be a big tipper. They will ignore you and not provide the same service as large groups. They will also seat you in the bar instead of the actual restaurant. This is not only annoying, it's uncomfortable and made me feel like an outcast. Jokes on them, I usually tip 40-60% because I own a restaurant and know how hard the front of the house works.","2016-10-11","1","bqDFZDfDPdCut0CbybDUrA","q9jZUebCdCEOXYPsuTdVJQ"

"I would give the Q a solid 3 of 5 stars. I had the wings and mac and cheese and a side of deviled eggs. The wings themselves were pretty good but the jerk sauce is definitely some crappy store bought concoction. The wings were a better than average size. The mac and cheese well lets just say its not. A greesy oily clump of noodles with burnt fried cheese on top. Yeah its that bad. The deviled eggs are definitely not your grandma's eggs but hey at least the plate presentation was on point.","2016-03-02","0","gHMkTOvq89eNuVxnpF444w","7gr43o1AijunYd5h1gKrmQ"

Usually too loud to carry on a conversation so not good for a first date unless you both love music. Only tried some of the food but everything I remember was delicious.

I had the burger and wedge fries with gravy to dip on the side for bunch\/lunch. The meat was cooked nicely and the gravy and fries were nice. The next time stopped in I had the black pepper and lime fries as a snack; which were really good.

We ordered spicy level 7, which it definitely the top of my spice limit. We had chicken tikka spicy level 7, as well, and 2 orders of garlic naan. Jamie was really nice and very helpful when making suggestions about what to order. Glad they deliver, too!

"We order from here every 2nd call...China Gourmet King is our other go to for take-out Mets Chinois. The food is very good, authentic and reasonably priced. They are a small business so occasionally a small error is made but they always make amends. I used to order from Kam Keep when it was in the same location but when they started doing tourist bus tours I thought enough is enough: Either you're a restaurant or a travel agent but not both. Too bad cuz they had good chow.","2016-08-27","0","yPR8Bh55-9NXmooZS7lrLA","b7PanVxwFm-yXIC7rD7-xQ"

My kids have eaten inside herringbone in La Jolla and Santa Monica and they love it.  My kids eat off the adult menu, are well behaved, and are not allowed to use ""I-devices"" at the table.  They are better behaved than most adults. They eat better than most adults.  I think it's a despicable rule.

"This place is a big ripoff! I spent $92.00 for one regular and one seafood buffet. They did have a big variety of food, but none of it was astounding! The seafood was mediocre at best! 
My wife is a vegetarian. The cashier told us there were plenty of vegetarian options, but that wasn't true. She said the buffet at Golden Coral tastes better.

I was very disappointed for the short time period that they lost a chef in the kitchen, but I can say that I am absolutely thrilled that Jessie Rae's BBQ came in. The food is absolutely fantastic! The Belt Buckle (Brisket atop waffle fries with drippings and Bama sauce) and God sauce are my absolute favorites.

"Watch out for you not getting your drinks comped and not being told. Not that I mind or can't afford to pay for my drinks but I was gambling as soon as we came in and my husband sat down beside me and ordered a few drinks and we kept putting bills down on the counter to pay for it but they never took them. 
Now we're Las Vegas locals and typically what that means is that the bartenders feel that you're gambling enough to pay for your drinks and your significant other's as well, I was wrong.","2017-01-14","0","3Qe4M3JNs7yIRXP13g-NYA","k8O3rGlZPYHEqTdXrGAMBQ"

"M&J Eastside Deli has great pastrami sandwiches and their burgers are fantastic. Everything is made in-house. The pastrami is cured on site. The burger meat is ground when an order is placed and is cooked to perfection. The fries are cut from whole potatoes and even the bread and buns are homemade.

"3 employees said, ""Someone will be right with you"".  We were the only ones waiting. Our order was finally taken.  While we waited an unreasonable amount of time, about 20 minutes the place filled up and one of our orders came out.  A few minutes later the Affogato came out.  People were waiting and waiting. The ice cream was 17.00 for an Affogato and 1 large scoop. It was very good. The employees are perfectly nice but I have no idea what they were doing to get our order ready.","2017-06-30","0","jY2RWYyP42EhEtmhfQrnPQ","1hqrm9mXWpKLq3a9wOJLeA"

"This time of year the trees in our neighborhood drop yellow buds of some sort into the street and our homeowners management company uses Blue Marble to keep everything tidy. So today I watch the Blue Marble folks come up the street to, what I assume is, blow this stuff into piles and remove. Boy was I wrong. Instead they just blew everything into our yards.

Today we ordered food for the office and got the banana pudding. I hate to admit it but, we were not impressed!! Definitely not the same quality and quantity of food as before. It's very unfortunate. I don't think we will be returning.","2017-09-15","0","z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w","zASNv08N9GKDzbCsZntisQ"

He told me to, ""go fuck myself"". He said, ""fuck the military"" and that he didn't care what some ""old white mother fucker"" said.

Service was ok.. we were kind of picky.  20% gratuity on EACH of our checks because there were 7 of us.  No kids menu either, luckily the 2 children were ok eating what we had.

"Ordered their chicken, spaghetti and corn.  The chicken was really juicy and i was salavating for a taste, sadly though there was no taste, it was bland bland bland.  No salt even.  The corn tasted like it was from a can and although the spaghetti portion was large, the noodles were over cooked and soft to the point of almost mushy.  In my opinion, not worth the hype and if you want flavour go elsewhere.","2017-08-03","0","51lFCPpAZz4t7-BrpLHf5g","yvcZN7H2pmeGXMV2pHpozw"

Just my principle!  I guess I was sold by the salesperson a bag that was no longer shelf-new. (Fashion show mall)","2012-09-01","0","SIYpdFCOWEJLRnP2WGjbGg","tPgg-ckMQuEGesjgBD7XCA"

"Another review for MY...ladies she is very good with what she does. She never rushes her work. Pays attention to detail. Perfectionist is her style. That's what we pay for when we invest in getting our nail done. I decided to change up my nail look so I went for the ""almond "" design and color...wow! I love the look! Please please give her a try. Let her know what you want. She is so easy to work with. She want you to be HAPPY  when you leave. If your not, she fix it.

"First time here at this location.  As a semi self serve  restaurant, i believe its a decent place to enjoy your dinner or whatever the case is. Why i say semi self serve? well they had good attitudes and serves you food, BUT all drinks are self serve. which is not a big deal. Water is free(water bottles). I tired Lamp,Chicken wings, and Chicken Joints Skewers. Taste decent! not bad at all. Great idea on the idea of a heat table (my picture).

Next time when I come and if I see she is in charge, I won't come inside. Feeling insulted and disappointed of her personality.","2017-08-21","0","JobEckBpEYmm_L9JOe8TEg","lgv8qZzHvwMA8VJLL3GGzA"

"Worst place ever because their service is horrible. As soon as it's the slightest bit busy they no longer see you as a human and consider you just a number. No one approaches or welcomes you to take your order so it is very easy to get lost in the shuffle. They won't think twice about casting you to the side and losing your business. Makes you question why you should even bother since it's for crappy mall-quality food.","2016-03-30","0","OlBFLXVJfze2ZZA4UUBS0g","krJw8HFQMl2lP8fbHvEGuw"

"I was born and raised in Peru and I've been to several Peruvian restaurants here in town. However, this is probably one of the best pollos a la braza I have tried here in Vegas. You guys need to ask your server for some ají and mayonesa for your pollo a la braza and don't forget to save room for some yummy picarones as dessert. Enjoy!","2017-11-09","0","K7ESHh6Uh5NptgI5bfsShQ","sC_FX_znspR9dAft3vb6Jg"

"I got my nails done here once for pride but they didn't do a good job. They're fairly clean but they didn't give me what I asked for. They cut too short and took too long. Also if you are into gel nails and all, their prices are too expensive and for a new place they are very inflexible. They will charge you to remove nails even if done there and they charge extra for shellac on gel nails. You can find a way better deal in Toronto!","2016-08-15","0","JI43hSF4G-MIAp1pq0G0GA","Fk0_5p_SLwcT9-PDvZ0ecg"

"If you like realllly sweet tasting donuts, their original flavor donuts (like chocolate glazed for example) aren't your best bet. The dough itself isn't extremely sweet, which is something I like and look for in a donut, but I know not everyone else does.

"Yes, its a little small. Perfect for lunch though.

It was like a less greasy, less salty five guys. Flat top grilled, a good crust on the meat, welldone throughout but not dry.

The toppings added a freshness that was welcome, and I wasnt falling asleep at my desk from eating too heavy.

Fries were crispy, salty. Not my very favorite, maybe not even up to the burger's standard but still tasty. But the jalapeno aioli more than rescued them.","2016-08-11","0","li0sU2BBM6P8B5u5-RRCMA","yeviL062OUk-CjileTr2Pw"

"He seemed professional at first. I paid him for my photos and to edit. After the shoot he tried to date me told him I had a boyfriend.  He took forever to get the pictures back to me. When I asked about them he just emailed me the photos and said he didn't have time to edit. After I paid him the money to edit as well! Total jerk! Will never recommend him.

Don't listen to Yessita M's. review! The food is the best in  Cave Creek\/Tatum Ranch and has been since they opened in March.

"While walking through the Venetian browsing through all the options for dinner we came across this brand new gem!
The service was incredible and David our waiter took great care of us along with Ryan the director of beverages.  Ryan recommended an Italian beer I had never heard.
I had the pesto ravioli and my wife had the lemon risotto.  The ravioli was amazing and would definitely recommend it!
We started with some meat and cheese which would get again in a heartbeat.","2016-08-04","0","WX8cx6tfFcEn0cK4cIbWag","nMZS0eJCbKwtD_ailMsWqg"

The First time, they cut our schnauzers goatee completely off (even after I made a note in his profile and told the guy at the front desk).

"Love Chompies Scottsdale, Tempe, Paradise Valley. Arrowhead is having some serious growing pains. Been there 6 times in the past 6 months. Only once did it meet the standard set by the founders. Never offered the pickle tray - a nice touch at other locations. So, I asked but only once did it arrive. Food order often wrong. Example, ordered lean corn beef, paid extra but didn't get it. Service is slow. I'm a big fan so I'm not giving up yet. Hopefully the owners will stop by to straighten out.","2016-12-27","0","lepAu9fXw5R93v0b6mj3vQ","Aa_gN5ytXmEDGfa1ZJa9OQ"

What i ordered was not the same as shown on the menus picture. The waiter told me they did not have what the picture shows even though the first waiter said they had it when i placed the order. They got into an argument with me even though i am the customer and did not offer to change my plate.

It was 120 minutes which was the first misrepresentation. sales people are very pushy. They bring in a cheesy sales guy for the presentation. They joke and try to be friends.

"New restaurant, so I go try. oh my god, food tastes horrible, I thought there would be a lot of beef options, but there was only 4 types of beef choice. There was only 1 page of choice. We ordered 5 plate of mushroom, they gave us 1 plate, we ordered 7 plate of mushroom again, and they gave us the same portion. 
The worst thing is they force you to pay 12% tips. The table next to us refused to pay that 12% service fee and called the cops. Service is ok but you cannot focus me to pay.","2016-05-09","0","1cGgVvEbuBlW2GDvJ112vA","liAou56JVsNNyDJHSfrNeA"

"If you care about your veteran's DO NOT go here. I was a regular here and witnessed the owner kick a veteran out with his PTSD dog  because it violated ""their"" policy, keep in mind that not one person complained about the dog, he took it upon himself to go out of his way to look up a policy that forbids any dog from a eating establishment. The bartender quit onsite and lost every customer at the bar that witnessed that bullshit. PISSED!","2017-04-29","0","1x8_aJQ-iqvymhRK3SNbLg","trxeH4N2k9aMqOFF_FWytw"

"This restaurant is a refreshing addition to Boca Park. Everything is fresh and on display for diners to make selections. You can choose from vegetables, meat and seafood, pastas and a variety of sauces. Your selections are combined with your choice of sauces and grilled on a large circular grill. On Wednesday there is a Jazz combo playing and on Thursdays an amazing singer. You must visit this Bradley Ogden restaurant in Boca for a wonderful total experience.","2016-11-19","0","YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw","MoKQthJiJxDSqykltxZCDg"

"Was here about 3 months ago, the selection of items was lacking (how can you be out of spinach and crimini mushrooms), quality of what they did have was at best average. I have been following the comments about them ever since and I'm not getting warm fuzzies. They keep changing their hours too, conflicting open hours on websites. I predict that it is only a matter of time and this place will be a memory. Sad because the concept is great, but correct delivery of that concept is mandatory.","2017-06-10","0","YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw","HN64_tkiHJhVc3hT1AR-tw"

"They have some really good stuff here! The lobby has a comfortable feel to it as well. The bud tenders are knowledgeable & friendly. The only down fall about it at times is, while in the show room, for some reason they always skip people. I got skipped a couple times while there. Also, another down fall is whenever I get a pre-roll (maybe it's just me) but it's poorly packed, ripped, or the weed is coming out. Still love the products. There is just some wiggle room for improvement. :)","2017-10-19","0","yeiS_cpJyxMYuYtBPxkYyA","o2le7wscgPa8viG7878zFw"

"Disappointing that a locksmith advertising auto rekeying would turn down a customer with cash, car-title, and ID in hand with a 3.5 day timeframe. That they declined to cut a most basic solid key shows the aim is to make money off service out-calls. Or that their website is false. Or that they're simply too lazy to make money. Who knows??

"This is my absolute favorite frozen dessert shop in the greater Charlotte area.  The flavors are fantastic, the prices are fair, the offerings are all homemade on sight, and the local family who owns it are so friendly!

Pro-tip:  Ecuadorean sorbetto is the same as Italian, but Ecuadorean gelato is dairy-free.  The gelatos were  just as rich and creamy as gelatos I've had with dairy, so you wouldn't know it had no fat and very few calories unless they told you.","2017-07-14","0","CAy7twD5McMiNrkFWOUn7g","gt-m4PiUfTPGjIgB9UhjQQ"

That being said I felt like I have had better at Taco Bell. No joke. The meat was dry as a Steel Cactus would be if you tried to eat it, sauces tasted like they were out of a jar, cheese tasted moldy.

I think this is because the employees are dancing, singing, and really having a great time goofing off in full view of all of the patiently waiting customers.  If there are 5 people behind the counter, typically 2-3 are dancing and chatting it up, leaving 2-3 employees to handle the long lines alone.  Every time.

"I ordered Mac and cheese. It came before my friends food, so it was either eat alone or wait for everyone to get served. I shouldn't have worried, because it was inedible. The worst. Also, our table was right between the bar and wait station with the traffic pattern right next to it. Felt very noisy and like we were in the middle of a train station.  They were out of several beers on the menu. My husband loves this place, but I'd rather not return. They did comp me for the M&C.","2017-05-10","0","CvonRhKDJaH155xhtpz_iw","gRSTIXOtF-9SO7YaNigDFw"

As soon as you walk in you can smell the deliciousness being made, they had a great options in their display and the peanut butter banana stood out to me so I ordered it.

The size of the cinnamon roll alone was well worth it, the toppings on mine which were fresh chopped bananas with peanut butter just mixed so well that it melted in my mouth.

"It appears that even the cold sandwiches go into a Panini iron, making them hot. The cold turkey pesto sandwich I ordered came as a hot Panini and was actually very delicious, but if you are expecting a cold sandwich be sure to ask them not to put it into the Panini maker, thereby making it hot. It's baffling they list hot paninis as cold sandwiches, but they are delicious!","2016-10-04","0","52yWGkwnrQXIjvuMjYxsiA","wZkg5jRVFLTMv6JYEYfMVw"

"My favourite burger places in the area. Opened a year ago. Fresh, tasty meat and chicken cooked to order. My boyfriend and I love 'The Smoking avo'. We also love their sweet potato fries and chunky chips, I had melted cheese on them on Saturday night (I'm bad, I know). I also love to support non-chain businesses and like the fact that these guys are doing what they love and are good at it. Can't recommend them enough.

"Went in for a quick take out order. Ordered the halibut fish & chips combo. The service was great, everyone was friendly and I was in and out relatively quick. 

Now in terms of the food itself, the fish was mediocre at best, the fries on the other hand were horrible! They tasted like burnt paper mixed in with old oil, just a horrible overall taste.

I'd say skip this one and try another fish & chips joint.","2016-08-14","0","hbfrNa3AtaR0cCU0myREPA","5iANfKEFe4L_y9M1liMPcw"

Chantel is very knowledgeable and cheery, I thought she was he manager with how she carried herself and knew so much about tanning procedures and products! I'm guessing she will be soon enough!

"I went to Las Vegas for the business trip last week and went to Chubby Cattle for dinner. Actually, I have never seen a conveyor belt in any other hot pot restaurant. It was a totally fun experience for me. Aside from the food, the staff is super friendly. Hopefully, they will open a new chain in New York City!!!

The front desk can't keep an appointment though. I've shown up to appointments and have to wait (because they put me in later than what they told me) or I've lost a slot (because they put me in earlier than what I was told over the phone).

My hairdresser really took her time with me and the massage and hair wash was one of a kind. This is a very unique hair salon and I recommend everybody to book :)","2017-08-16","0","4lv8SODfR9CntvefpWHwEg","kDg9s4_41kiiaOmF8B4ipQ"

"Don't come here! In my entire life, this was by far the poorest service I've ever received at any restaurants, in the world. Perhaps they were severely understaffed, but we were neglected and ignored to the point it was just disrespectful. And I did not appreciate the servers' attitudes while I was still being polite. Food is mediocre and not even decently priced. This is my first and last time here.

Also, when it comes to stage, dancers that don't have a license, can't take any clothing off, and new girls don't know what to do. If you ever go back ask for jewels, Julie, autumn, Mary Jane, or Dakota. I've seen them dance, they take clothes off, very nice, and they don't ""rip you off"".

"I always went to one stylist which was Laura, and one day I did a walk in and asked if she was there & she wasn't but I decided to trust this new stylist. WHICH was a big no no . I showed her a picture of how I wanted my hair done , which an ombré black and red and she gave me highlights, she was very messy in her work she got dye on my forehead , ears, and arms. And also kept getting water in my ears. I was extremely disappointed because it was nowhere near the style I wanted.","2016-09-11","0","93SJUCg-ZVkrBPtHE8BI-Q","8P0uW98tioXC_yGj9UchnA"

"I was supposed to be at the breakfast place across the street but ended up here accidentally since I had just moved to the area. Not very pleased with the service. I had Spanish omelette which was okay but the coffee was cold (may be because it was on the house that day) and when I mentioned it is cold the server got defensive and said it was just made. That was awkward! Anyhow, not the best experiences I've had. I'm sure there are better places nearby!

"The one in Columbus is awesome! So we were excited that they were opening one here! Quality was great at first, but has gone downhill.  Food isn't quite as tasty and much to my disappointment, they changed their fries.  They used to be thin and crispy and were a must have every time I ate there. Now they are thicker and mushy.  They are fine but nothing amazing about them.  They also changed their point system, causing us to lose 300+ points.  They never followed up after we complained.","2017-12-02","0","zc0sUY7iWuJB93AHWKy_xw","z-13FoXWp5CB_fxHTHuNrw"

Not only do they offer a burger wrapped in lettuce (not bread), but chef prepared it exactly the way I imagined--well done, tender and juicy. It's hard to find that combination anywhere. And blueberries were floating in my Bumbleberry beer...as it should be! Also at our table--street corn, Cajun rubbed wings and hand cut fries--all exceptional!","2017-08-05","0","h8MMgum-XUQhU4xWCyQWLQ","Trc73l9MZRcuewLew9hA4Q"

"Just go for drinks. Food quality and service can fluctuate wildly depending on time of day, but if you sit at the bar, order drinks and maybe an app while watching a game, you'll have fun. The patio is nice, but realize that they are usually blasting commercial country songs through the outdoor, sometimes making conversation difficult. But if that's your jam, then this patio is a rather pleasant place to have a few beers.","2017-08-26","0","0kzPQQL8wVcHlBQzMdRdWQ","D3ubzB6RdOiMwJ6JFIL2Zw"

Kim was the first one here she is very sweet and helped me find a match for gel and regular polish for my toes which can be so difficult if it's not ""perfect match"". Most importantly she did an amazing job on my nails I will definitely come back and send a few friends over! Thanks Kim","2016-10-05","0","0qayzrNKvLTzRYbZvcKPAg","LJ5LVla3coDMhY9iYm9VNA"

"Customer service was non-existent. Walked in, was immediately handed a menu and told to read it. When I said it was my first time in and I wanted more information, I was passed off to another girl who said I need to sign up for emails. This place is supposed to offer meal plans, but as far as I was told nothing is dealt with at the actual store, all ordering and meals are made at and shipped from corporate. If I'm looking to spend  $100+ a week, I expect a courteous, knowledgeable staff.","2017-06-23","0","sf6xO8BDp2-IzP9oB1_C9A","INtZQ0e0RgeIg5vZKPWiVQ"

"(*positive @bottom) Dont order anything latenight as their delivery guy (2 times in a row) had so little English that we ended up not getting our order(between $20-40+I tip well) he couldn't communicate over the phone (when he ACTUALLY called)to deliver the pizza to a simple house address. Do walk-in or take your gamble.      *Honestly, OTHERWISE, they have decent pizza. Try their Canadian bacon. Also: cinnamon dessert is AMAZING, cheese &bacon bread is great if you get extra pizza sauce.","2017-01-22","0","-Ggr1M22MxTbP2J8L7oHqw","-qZuhM_sz4opDCWkG6LNEA"
"Not a full halal selection, they have 6 items to choose from which are extremely overpriced. $4.99\/lb for beef round???? This is typically $2-$3\/lb at any grocery store. Plus we always have to wait for a butcher for at least 5 minutes. They are always out of packaged halal meats, I guess we need to shop at the beginning of the week? The butcher insisted we try their kalamata olives, which were horribly brined and too salty. Just awful.","2017-07-30","0","Xrx33FtlglUKgjR3S8Qehg","6rmGr9xl_mOPSO8pxn-m8w"

"Take the secret stairs, between the cafe and main store 'up.' Be pleasantly surprised. Chill and dine in the upscale, industrial lounge, featuring wide screen TV's, casual seating, wifi and a bar!

The smaller, yet complete menu features a lighter fare of appetizers, (try one of their cheeseboards) soup, salads, (highly recommend the fresh caught salmon) and sandwiches. Very reasonably priced. The bar features lovely assortments of wines and a great assortment of beers from Triptych Brewing Co.","2016-10-23","0","-A4suUjxa7gNaiUMDjO42g","vEDr35Kmt6f3pba6q1Y1bg"

Notice there are only 3 reviews! 

My actual review has been placed in the ""not recommended"" section. Along with a half dozen others. 

It's been recommended for 6 months now suddenly..it's not. I'm curious to see what reason Yelp has for my review demotion.

We stopped in the other day for meat for stew, Roni helped out and we left with the fixings for beef bourguigon. I left with pork belly for flavor, beef meat, and an absolutely killer marrow broth. We have never been disappointed. The beef bourguigon was awesome.

Chopped salad w\/more lettuce than anything else.  The chicken was the size of two chicken tenders and not grilled.  Looked forward to the Nutella dessert.  Absolutely no flavor there, just an icky cheesecake excuse.  Those positive reviews are Lamp cafe employees\/friends.  We'll see how long the cafe lasts. My husband &I won't be back.

He did absolutely nothing to fix the problem, took my $75 check and left.  I called AHS back and was told that the owner of Husky denied ever coming to my home and said that I had cancelled the service call.

I prefer this Raman more than the other Raman places I've tried in town.  Saltiness is just right.  Noodles were good.  My favorite part of the bowl is the pork belly.  Super tender.  

I asked Morris what else I should order the next time I dropped by and he recommended his favorite: Miso Raman.","2017-06-09","0","Woqed5Fw95J6oEZxIHiBgg","MPdgBB1CfE0JEtfo7Ok0Vg"

I called the waitress and showed the lack of turkey. She apologized and took back. The picture I posted is the second turkey sandwich. Really?

"Exactly what tourists from convention needed! An ultra lounge that was built beautifully. Behind the main entrance, they built a beautiful bird cage. Towards the end of the venue, there is a room that is called ""the library""  that has a in built fireplace. Great room to have a few cocktails w friends or for a meeting. Craft cocktails are all fresh and created by a well known mixologist. Juices are made fresh everyday and the apple juice is made by order!","2017-01-18","0","uczILVmOHqosb7XZeDSlOw","_aZjMo7S66A_QflkXnXEjA"

"I really wanted to love this place.But there was nothing about it that makes me want to return.   The waitress was slow and had an angry demeanor. When our food arrived the bacon, which I had requested to be cooked extra crispy, was not cooked. It was so uncooked as to be unhealthy. I couldn't eat it.
My husband said his ham was ok, his orange juice watery and his biscuits and gravy nothing special. 
For this breakfast we spent $27 for two of us.

Maybe they used Chinese spicy oil to create the taste, since the top of broth shows the same oily film. The presentation is very lacking....the spinach were just thrown on top.

"This is my first time at the poke spot. I've been to a similar concept. But this was a great experience. We love to find a place healthy with fresh food. There are so many choices especially with sauces (not a bad thing) but they will help you perfect the sauce your pallet craves.  let you taste combinations perfect sauce for your likings I ordered the miso soup today . They added seaweed, tofu? But I would add green onion. The owners\/managers take pride in what they do. Welcome to Grayhawk!!","2017-07-01","0","vA7gCRT0JsgSYy0U8NY0nA","QelWJxn862za5lVXfvCJcg"

"There should be one main entry.  The Host cannot always be outside\/ visible when coming in through the other entrance as was the case when we entered.  We walked into the restaurant lost before a timid worker finally approached us.

Secondly, the goblets are $30 each and the kids really want these drinks. Yes, they can be made without alcohol but someone should come up with a more reasonable size and price point.  I get the concept but I guess you're marketing the restaurant for adults.","2017-08-03","0","-oUM2uISux96lMGeawHIOA","Lo-Jl6upzjX7Pvkn2r0IYQ"

The body scrub and the hot oil massage were excellent and I am very happy with it. They also offer disposable spa robe that I haven't seen in other similar place. Overall I felt relax and I highly recommend this place.","2017-04-02","0","Ew3Rhc_amz-BuGtlp3j33g","tIL9DeR44q9f7cdlK_4fFA"

"Battery works fine, case is horrible! I've had the case 3 months and the bumper that secures the battery has broken TWICE!! It's made of cheap plastic and broke in the same spot twice, I had to BUY a new bumper and then that one broke. It's such a problem that they actually sell replacement bumpers, they don't replace them you have to buy a new one for $6 every time it breaks. Until they can come up with a redesign bumper STAY AWAY, not worth the money.","2017-03-23","0","exGLYhOPYOJM2qizOcUhVw","iGZ6vxCbbceMc16Y9Z4rGw"

"I just got a pedicure done here today. The place looks beautiful when you walk in and the staff is super friendly but the service was not good at all. My boyfriend and I went in for a pedicure and after leaving I noticed my calluses on my feet were not fully scrubbed off. I can literally peal it right off.

"My wife and I went on a weekday night. We arrived at 430. The hostess asked if we had a ""reservation"". We did not. She then informed us that the entire restaurant was booked with reservations. She also never asked if we wanted to sit in the bar, so we assumed there was nothing there as well. We then left and went to the adjoining art gallery for about a half hour. We were curious, so we checked back into the restaurant at 5. No extra customers were seated in the restaurant.

"Very disappointing visit to their new location.  We had gone several times to their original location and the cookies were delicious.  We decided to try their new location on Friday because we read that they would be serving coffee to go along with their cookies.  Needless to say, that wasn't the case.  No coffee.  No working bathroom.  My all-time favorite cookie, chocolate chip, was small, overpriced at $1.99, and tasted like it came from a bag of Chips Ahoy, which probably would taste better.","2017-04-15","0","mVomtOMgBxbGvdPSaF2HjQ","Itwv3ycYgVk8LF4uW-W6cg"

The plate comes with chopped up iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and didn't include the usual tabule, pickled turnip, pickles, onions and no garlic sauce.

"Expensive and poorly executed ""tech-concept"" airport bar. Agree with other reviewers-this place is dirty and grimy. Tables were dirty with spills, napkins, dirty glasses, and crumbs. Bar stools are poorly designed at a slant so you're always sliding off. Not comfortable. Food looked gross. $10 for what is described as ""homemade"" guacamole, which is served in a tiny dish. Ouch.","2015-08-30","0","rGCDSZczGBSdLN9wiz0iXw","lWSZULrLk-RJaYhzSoKqWA"

"This is the worst restaurant I ever ever have bern in all my life. I felt like a DOG yes!! I received my food in a plastic bag with no plate, no forks, NOTHING !! When my husband was trying to eat, I saw him trying to get the food from the plastic bag with his hands and that was humillating, offensive !! Also the food is just rinse with the salsa you choose on top of the boiling shrimps, it was just HORRIBLE !! I am wondering if the CITY knows how we get the unhealthy   Bags.

They were able to do everything we needed from landscaping, irrigation and lighting.  Whenever I've texted or emailed Luis he has gotten back to me within the hour.

"Tracy was amazing and went way beyond the call of duty in making our wedding ceremony perfect. In the planning process, she met with us to get to know us and understand our family dynamics and individuals needs. She made excellent selections and worked with us to find the perfect ceremony words - including elements from our Greek and Jewish cultures. She spoke beautifully and kept us calm during a stressful beginning to our wedding day. She's a true professional and we were blessed to have her!","2017-08-02","0","wSNFfVa3ijabhCw2vQ3x1w","r930h3YomXtl7C9jk6OhdQ"

"Warm, inviting space; looks fantastic when compared to the restaurant that had been here before. Lots of space between tables; not touching elbows with other patrons. 

Free roasted peanuts with Chili and Szechuan ""numbing"" peppers was my only enjoyable ""numbing"" pepper experience so far. Very tasty. 

Menu prices are really low, like the vegetarian dishes are under $8. The point is to try more than one dishe. It's a ""noodle bar"", not a ""choose your entrée"" restaurant. Every item is recommended.","2017-11-15","0","o4gB1zWiCHgbjq-tNFRW-g","jFy4tX2i8NjzWnuyuB7i8Q"

"This place is awful. First off, charging $20 for a pizza outside of uptown with one topping is robbery. Second, I requested an extra crispy pizza and when I showed up they said they burnt it too much and had to cook another one. The picture attached is what I got. An undercooked mess. I'll never go back.","2017-10-17","0","yatT2q_zmb4-yvzr9Bx5lA","Rh7wWVElAjKWYhhHikD3nA"

"First time visiting this place and did not like it one bit. 1st off they didn't honor their promotion on restaurant.com.  I was suppose to get $25 off on a $50 tab. The waitress and manager seem to not know the promotion. He had to call the owner, Frank, which he didn't honor the deal. Instead, he offered me 20% off I was like that's not the same as the promotion. Their food is way over priced. They say they sell sushi but it's not on the menu.

I can say the poor server tried her best but overall.hot mess!!

"Totally agree with Nicole L.  The vermicelli was way over cooked and I they didn't use the traditional thin vermicelli; they used the thick vermicelli. Also ordered a young coconut on the hope that it'd be fresh. It didn't taste too bad but they didn't cut it well enough. I was left picking pieces of coconut out of the juice like I eating fish with bones. Overall would recommend for an average Viet meal. Not blown away by any means.","2017-10-01","0","HT_eV18wKa8WzCz8UsTVZA","6ifce5dqWkYyOEI6NA1yvw"

"Tried to eat here.  Told 30 minute wait even though dining room was half empty.  And was only 5th on list.  Hostess said kitchen was slow.  She said they just opened so I shouldn't expect it to be fully operational. I told her then maybe they shouldn't expect people to pay full price.  While I waited three people returned togo orders kitchen got wrong.  Ended up leaving.  Menu is very expensive for average size sand which.  Ten dollars for a Kinish.  Latkes look frozen.  Ended up leaving.","2017-09-29","0","fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA","VfLnL3x7WvpzOTZzpGdipQ"
"These are some really bad reviews. I'm from NY, LA, now living in Las Vegas. I actually thought my Pastrami sandwich was better than Canters in LA. NY style. Cooks are from Katz's in NY. Hand carved, great pickles and Cole slaw. Our waiter Brett was terrific. However, it really is pricey. $18.95 for the sandwich. That's an issue. I don't even think Carnegie was that much!","2017-10-06","0","fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA","Z9tmHowxNpXePyVoZSL6xw"

"The burger was alright but what was most disappointing was the customer service. It was horrible, no vegan vibe whatsoever. The employees pretty much gave resting bitch face and were appalled at the request for fresh water. 
After being laughed at raucously, I will not go back and I will let the vegan community know how mainstream and corporate this ""vegan"" restaurant is.
Planta Burger, you get an F my friend for failing at veganism it all it's essence.","2017-09-23","0","2xn5cEvhZFxFRcnxhcT0Yw","hoDCcVffV2m89Fsjhq5HZQ"

"Huge fan of Kimpton- came for Merchant and Trade, but were told we needed reservations. Went to dinner instead. Service was spotty but it's opening night.  Queen City salad delicious, full of flavor.  Branzino crudo -very strange dish, components never melded together and I LOVE crudo!!   Husband's risotto ok, lacked flavor and not really risotto, just rice with a leek sauce.

They are very personable and professional. Danny remembered me when I came back for my fill. The place is immaculate inside, modern and clean, I neatly fell asleep on the comfortable bed (even gave me a blanket) while Anna did my lashes.
I am blown away from the finished product. Looks amazing, natural and beautiful. Highly recommend this place, I signed up for the membership
