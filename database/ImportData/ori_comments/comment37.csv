"I had a massage by Chelsea and the service was not relaxing or good. She clearly massaged over knots that needed to be worked out. She breathed heavy the whole time which made me feel uncomfortable. I could hear people talking through the walls. I also asked for my back and feet to be worked on only and somehow ended up with a full body massage. I would not recommend this place because there are too many other options in the area that are way better. Massage Heights would be a better bet.","2016-07-24","0","YT--S47-0A68dP-Fw-bT-A","ATwrhfrILU48_siKGdvkAA"

"I just ate the best brisket sandwich ever. I'm a serious BBQ snob and finding this place in Phoenix I was skeptical. The brisket was perfect. Smoky and blackened on the ends and yet tender and juicy, seriously they give you sauce but I didn't want to ruin it. The bun was amazing and toasted with butter. I waited about ten minutes in line but it was worth it. The staff are super friendly and the venue is pretty cool. Highly recommend this place!!","2017-05-16","0","VtgFuz3LXsrGB-SzPSQbDg","iOIznOBI_pl8Wye614_hbw"

"I've been looking for a good salon\/spa where I can feel comfortable and is sanitary. Finally found this where I can have a Brazilian Wax again next month. The lady is nice and she does not reuse the applicator unlike other places I've been to. She is also thorough in doing the waxing and does not rush it. The regular prices are very reasonable to which I don't mind paying, $24 for a BW compared to $45 to $60 from others. I recommend checking this place out!","2015-07-09","0","LNsD1ZHQkHkfNGb2tD-jQg","I-fIFc5_uXwmYP80IvOJ1Q"

"I came here faithfully until the change of ownership. I stopped coming after one of the employees offered to ""give me free"" sessions after I had exhausted my package in exchange for a minimum fee. So, I attribute the new owners behavior to her frustration with trying to comprehend why the numbers are t adding up. So, in her defense I will say it's true Employees  were stealing money from her.

"Download the new free app called CakePay... makes dining so much easier.  You can check in, give your server the 4 digit code and pay thru your phone instead of waiting for your check.  You can even split your checks or pay for someone else that's  dining at a Cheesecake Factory.  You can use your credit card or hook up your Pay Pal.  Great for when you're on lunch or in a rush to get out...","2016-05-15","0","NoA6bD6W7z_Aztk_cOU5cg","FCE_RnQBwb4KSnUopww2wA"

"I have been coming to LA tan for close to two years and became a member about 8 months ago. After going to other salons, I am very satisfied here. The equipment is top notch and unlike other places I have never gotten a burn and the tan is always perfect. Most of the staff are pleasant but in particular I have to say Sara is the best! She is very pleasant, always  remembers who I am and greets me with a smile. She is a pleasure to deal with and makes you feel like coming back !","2016-10-31","0","qXpvy10lWZuQZcFMhJZ8Rg","9b21fjpV5yHkTJdH22yXzQ"

"Horrible place to visit. We ordered 3 w\/ 1 being the mushroom & vegetable sizzler w\/ Schezuan sauce. The mushroom & vegetable sizzler came w\/ no mushrooms. When we told the server, she just got us some mushrooms on the side & said here you go. The owner didn't even apologize. He was convincing us dat we didn't miss out on anything. Y should I pay $20 for something which is not even half of what I ordered? Also too much sauce on the food making it difficult to taste anything else. Waste of money.","2015-12-28","0","lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw","WSfooHvv7T2LzhdazOucLw"

Ich bin wieder am k√∂stlichen Jim Knopf Burger h√§ngen geblieben ( er k√∂nnte einen Tick w√§rmer sein ) mit den super - leckeren S√º√ükartoffel Frites und einem Salat Sch√ºsselchen . Schmeckt nach mehr !! Bis bald !","2016-08-11","0","Di5QdSiP0Kd20abQvRSiTw","mHqroxeDrncDqZGBA74WHw"

He said he will never do that again since the other company was hours late, rude and had the worst Customer Service from the beginning. He will call Poindexter from now on when he moves out. Point is...no one can beat Poindexter and don't waste your time and money with the other ones pls!!","2016-03-28","0","0FgFNbsWQs2kYuYaWHSIYw","oXZKezezy6pnm2Oq7WTmmA"

Please reopen! This is the ONLY decent Indian Restaurant in Las Vegas that I would actually dine at and I believe other would too. I was so disappointed I could not find your restaurant anymore.

"A new gem of a restaurant right in my neighborhood. The food is refreshingly different from other places I have eaten. Our waiter, Josh, was engaging and very knowledgeable about every item on the menu. He took his time explaining the ingredients. He could write a blog on the food. He is that good. The interior is modern and spacious. My new favorite place.","2016-05-03","0","ElWzx5_fU8S2G45OnM-HpA","VMHAHZ46wE9P1EywW6MCcw"

"Came in an hour before closing. Didn't have someone come to the host stand for a good 5 minutes. Server finally came and said he'd check if the kitchen will still serve me food because kitchen closes at 11 when restaurant closes at midnight. That makes sense!Obviously didn't want to be served so I just said forget it and left. As a server myself, I've never heard that before. Correct me if I'm wrong. At least make it clear what time the restaurant closes. I would've been out of there before 12!","2016-01-20","0","44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ","RpyB9LqaBUShWFMRocasfw"

"AYCE is the best here. Fish is super fresh. Service is amazing. Normally with all you can eat, you are limited to very few rice filled basic rolls, not here, you get to choose basically anything you want. The rolls are made with attention to detail with extremely fresh fish. Will be back for sure.","2015-10-05","0","JJAwT9R6Fp2yyWHtWFA8uQ","-3Qil_ONGErPpr9cUGBVqQ"

"Up date to my review: We arrived a full 40 minutes prior to our showtime and the first snag we encountered was that the tix we purchased yesterday were issued for the wrong time, so it took 10 minutes to straighten that out. Then, on a very busy Sunday, loaded with kids, they had only 2 concession lines open, both long lines and slow service. Barely made it to our theater on time. Good thing the seats are reserved!
Tip: arrive PLENTY early!","2016-07-24","0","PTtBAaY1GgH929EjdlYLiA","2JQQPOEdIjx7jOCn55pcvA"

"We really like this place because it's close to home and reasonably priced. However, the past few times we've been here, it's been filthy. It didn't even appear they clean in between movies. Chocolate all over the seats, soda machines not working, and the self serve butter station is beyond disgusting. Takes away from the fairly recent renovation with the declining seats.","2017-11-21","0","PTtBAaY1GgH929EjdlYLiA","jIMbS8fzENrs2XL-AfScfA"

"Happened on Nani quite by accident, and what a happy accident it was!  They share a parking lot with the Americinn.

We have enjoyed dim sum in Hong Kong, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, etc., and Nani was as delicious, fresh and tasty as the best that we have had anywhere.

We especially enjoyed the shrimp dumplings, sticky rice steamed in lotus leaves, shrimp crepes and fried crab and seaweed.  I am a fan of tripe and theirs is delicious.

"We returned to what is now my favorite coffee shop in Las Vegas. Joseph described for us a new concoction he created called the Walter White (you have to have seen Breaking Bad to appreciate the namesake). If yo want the perfect espresso drink to get you going or keep you going, give this deliciously invigorating drink a try. Espresso with a touch of Carmel and a hint of chocolate rounded off with a little cream, this drink is divine.  For other adventures, check out this little gem of a cafe.","2015-11-28","0","Vbal-AZnu2w6NttIKfdjDg","e4uyqSXaYcjq8bCUowMFkA"

"The Bloody Mary bar is well worth it! Stuff as much on there as you can and its amazing. 

If you order the chicken and waffles, it's delicious but be prepared for the fried leeks. They're super tasty and I loved them but my boyfriend thought they were a tiny by over powering, so I ate half of his toppings. The waffle though is cooked perfectly. Perfect crispy, fluffiness you want in a waffle. 

Scrambles are ok. They're just eggs mixed with stuff but if that's your thing, then they are good.","2016-01-11","0","Yl05MqCs9xRzrJFkGWLpgA","SPFHjf2GtTWTqJz_Ngnwgg"

"Awesome atmosphere, good drinks, but the food is mediocre at best. The wait was long (probably because it's still new). The service was slow. They quoted us 1.5 hours on a Thursday evening. When we got seated, it took more than 15 mins for our server to get to us.  For what it is, it's incredibly overpriced. I'd much rather get good quality food from a local business, but it'd be a cool place to go for a night out - their drinks are pretty strong.","2017-07-13","0","TaEASKZil0TT7CAzyqFUgw","og-vD9plC5tinlV74Ohndg"

"My girlfriend and I went to Portillos in Tempe. I ordered a double bacon hamburger with no cheese and she ordered a hot dog with what with mustard ketchup and onions. First comment was no sauerkraut on hot dogs how dare they. Next thing I noticed when we got into the restaurant were herded in as cattle and then I paid to much. Double a hamburger tasted very bland. The fries were very salty I could taste the salt before the fries and hamburgers. I taste the condiments before the hamburger.","2013-11-24","0","6t7mlTVjDA9fhuFAZmVzAQ","gS_FgHvJ3O8oUA4qD2dDaA"

They explained it was Passion flower sweet syrup in what I ordered and Catrina came out to my vehicle to show me my other choices and swapped it out immediately. I'm the kind of person that usually won't bring anything back but I really wanted to try their tea. Catrina couldn't have been more of a sweetheart about switching it. I'll definitely b back.","2017-07-09","0","IhNASEZ3XnBHmuuVnWdIwA","M5lK_pYTJLM8--pYba3ubQ"

If you are caught off guard you will walk out with a huge bill, non-refundable purchase and no way to contact anyone about it.

"I walked in after dropping off my husband at college. I read all the good reviews on here so decided to take the chance. I only waited for about five minutes and the staff was very friendly. I already had acrylics so i only needed a fill. I ended up paying $60 for a fill, ONE gel design on each hand and just glitter on the rest. They did a great job but to me it was pretty pricey for a fill.Hopefully they last a while.","2016-03-14","0","Nrk1AJwGbvyY9M0zZVU4Tw","DseRQ6-fiKsDZ-1vKhFTUA"

"Couldn't have executed a better second location. This beer is unmatched, and will consistently blow your mind. 

The pizza holds up to fate north and they did a great job with the rest of the menu. Try the roasted grape salad and make sure you get a taste of the hot oil aioli. Still have never had a better beer cheese and pretzel. 

Just an all around fantastic spot to spend your time drinking incredible beer and delicious food. Do yourself a favor and just go there, often.

I was greeted with a warm welcome and explained the details of the menu. It was nice being educated on the menu because I wasn't left standing with no guidance. The food was great. I did the combo and thought it was a great value for your buck. The half sandwich size was above average & the chicken curry soup was better than expected.

It wasn't bad it just wasn't something I'll crave in the future.... But maybe I just need someone to tell me what's the best.

"This is my favorite place to get Korean BBQ in Henderson. It has become a regular spot my friends and I. I find the prices to be reasonable and, the food is just amazing. The staff is just outstanding as well. If you're lucky, you'll get a waiter named Ozzy. Super friendly, very helpful, and just makes the visit feel a little more special. Another plus about this place is that you aren't left thirsty or hungry as they tend to you in a reasonable amount of time.","2016-02-20","0","eLFfWcdb7VkqNyTONksHiQ","htHGulLEGgwfCNU_t0yM0Q"

What ever it was it wasn't good..."" And it's true.  The food quality has gone way down, there is no connection to the staff because of front counter order and pay.

You can also get wellness bowls and wraps, Superfood soups, acai and super fruit bowls, and nutrient dense snacks. The price can be a little steep, but everything they offer here is gluten free, organic, and is contributing to your body's well-being; for me, that's worth the extra couple of bucks.","2017-07-06","0","Jy6ru0Hz-9Yc5v006-YmUQ","HjJHdRq5sKt38zR8mbsz-Q"

"Such a GREAT car dealer! Got my new Toyota Camry from Phil. He was extremely helpful. He showed us cars on the lot and let me do some test drives. He gave useful information about each of the cars and when it came down to it I was trying to decide between the two and he really helped me figure out that the Camry would better fit my life! I definitely would buy another car from Ideal Cars and especially from Phil. Everyone was helpful and happy. Can't say enough positive things about Ideal Cars!","2016-04-11","0","QWgwVIaas0f1-LRibbHZVQ","nBSDX43YU2zRcxG2Z9Lspg"

I walked into Rollcare needing some attention and was tired of the walk in clinic close to my place. Things that impressed me the most:

- really short wait times during my visits. First visit was 15 minutes. 2nd visit was 8-10 minutes
- friendly and attentive staff
- kid friendly. I don't have kids but I noticed that some other patients were there with kids who were busy with kiddy books and activities. 
- pharmacy inside

"This place was sketchy AF!

Called a week ahead to book a couples massage and they asked if I wanted the same room so I said ""it's a couples massage, so yes.."" weird question.

It wasn't until we got there, paid, and were being shown to our room that they said ""the couples room wasn't available and we had to use different rooms.""

Well.. one of those rooms was basically a bed in a closet under a staircase.. sheets hadn't been washed in idk how  long. Massage wasn't great either.

Don't reccomend","2016-03-01","0","6B72pzt1Jy6rGqqu_pkMsA","GKqOeBM8XSqG7HfdQCDLLw"

"The ice cream is NOT GOOD. It melts so fast, while you are eating it you are creating a mess! You need a lot of tissue and one cup when you eat the ice cream. Ok, I get they're business idea of making an unique ice cream, but they are trying too hard.The ice cream just full of sugar and cream. When you are eating your hands are sticky, it's so easy to drip on your shirt, and you just don't feel good.  just because it's all over Instagram and Twitter, doesn't mean it's good.","2015-09-22","0","N_2yEZ41g9zDW_gWArFiHw","sgLcwunZZNZgdprC9FJwKA"

"Flock & Fowl has been serving the hungry chicken masses for near two years out of a humble 8 table restaurant. Recently featured in USA Today, Food & Wine Magazine, and the Las Vegas RJ, the restaurant can be quite busy mid-shift, so arriving closer to opening or after 2PM will yield a much higher success for parties larger than 4 getting sat and fed quickly. Typically, all ordering happens at register with the entire party arrived and ready to be fed. New larger location expected by year's end.","2017-07-07","0","68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw","b3cssGUI0x0w12L7yM1yLw"

"Gentle Dentil is not the place to go to if you want quality care.  I  swear, I heard them say that two different patients had number 6 deep pockets in their back teeth.  Because of this the patients couldn't have their annual cleaning.  First they would need ""deep cleaning"" to the tone of mucho bucks!!!!  After having two visits to have the ""deep cleaning"" then, they will do the ""regular cleaning"" and they will do it no other way.  I wouldn't send my dead dog to that place.","2017-04-20","0","AgHXtE1Tc9W9ER3mABz2WQ","9_jG5Wc6753VAaZCYiX0kw"

"My first time review and first try of chicken and waffles. Let's just say this place did not disappoint. A hidden spot that serves hot, fresh and tasty comfort food. During this visit we ordered Leroy's chicken and waffles as well as the special called the""mother clucker"". Both dishes filled our bellies and created huge smiles on our faces. Food is on point and the service was too. Made us feel right at home. Definitely going back to try out the other items on the menu.","2015-10-31","0","VwdnJPb5WG8lM_whsZasHw","XjXl3N26otK4gtWhcSuL1w"

"Let's start by I needed a bigger vehicle for my family of 5. So I went to Car Guru.com they sent to this Johnny legends. They had a suburban and that was the type I was looking for. So I went there to see if I can get it or not so they got all of the information from me and my wife. Then the next day they wanted me and my wife to come down. So after work we went their just to find out that we was not approved to get the vehicle.  I will recommend this place to get a vehicle.","2017-08-04","0","Ch_iMphfKLaWbBdzbtc3Ow","w_ncKCr935xzTD9EkF_2gg"

"Always nervous about ordering Indian food. I'm originally from England where Indian food is everywhere and the standards are high because of the competition. After 26 year's in Vegas I've finally found my home away from home. My favorite is lamb vindaloo, hard to do, but when it's right it's amazing. This dish took me home, right about of heat, potatoes and lamb. Looking forward to my next visit.

"The sign ""Pizza"" doesn't do this place justice. Antonio's has an amazing quality in his ingredients, I've had Magiano's, and they must be getting their ingredients from the same places. Strongly recommend the Abtonio's signature pizza, dont just get a slice, youll want to eat the entire thing. Its always oven fresh, so let it sit for about 5 minutes, the juicy chicken and perfectly ripe tomatoes need a moment to cool. I dont know how he gets the toppings to be so hot, but keep their consistency.","2015-10-15","0","a2aIe4d-d7wUtkWsnIiEVQ","mYWYVoQwR4BEhDoh9b8pEA"

"Not worth it, please don't go, this is my honest review

***SMELL IT BEFORE YOU EAT***

We came and ordered South Indian thali, they gave spoiled subjee and  has bad smell, it's clearly smell like it's gone, but the reply from them this recipe is like that.

Another family also ordered and they also suspected but the reply is the same 

They are not accepting their mistake and they are defending, this was the worst experience I had

"Don't go! Best tip you'll get. So many other Italian restaurants to choose from- no reason to go here. Food is reheated slop, service obnoxious and snooty.","2016-08-27","0","2PDCtdFPRaXdqKtVrx0aIg","w8SrcCOJ6gKzYPG708EG2A"
"If you're not in the 'in' crowd you will not be comfortable here.  The menu is very limited (appetizers are tuna-heavy)  and the service is spotty at best. The 'deli' case is distracting and seems out of place. The acoustics also do not lend to intimate conversation as they blast obnoxious music. The management should take a page from Mangiafoco's book and learn to better their customer service.

"I came here with a friend while on vacation. I'd  never eaten hot pot before. The staff explained how to order and gave recommendations. I picked the tomato broth and my friend had the spicy broth. We ordered thinly sliced lamb, five spice beef, chicken, tofu and vegetables for our first course. We ordered Ramen and udon  for our second course. We were offered dessert but were  too full. Based on this experience, I would definitely go back and will try hot pot again. Pay with  cash for 10% off.","2016-05-25","0","L_tieGcFMQVSmk7XiA093A","auE-K0V0zGid16wD3Dd03Q"

"1. There was a piece of hair in the rice... With the follicle intact
 
2. It took about 15 mins to make my dish because, they ""never"" got my order (even though it showed on the same receipt)

3. The employee refused a customer of a hot cup of water. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is illegal to refuse someone of a cup of hot water. The customer came back to purchase water afterwards

"Finally had the opportunity to visit. We were a party of 10 on a Sunday afternoon. The pizza looked great when it arrived. The anticipation was high but the results were bland.  The crust on the Chicago classic tasted like a dry saltine cracker.  The sauce was nothing spectacular.  The thin crust sausage was better but still nothing great.

"Don't order the Piccata. It is not piccata in any sense of the word. Also, don't come here if u are a woman dining alone or ""look"" like you won't be a big tipper. They will ignore you and not provide the same service as large groups. They will also seat you in the bar instead of the actual restaurant. This is not only annoying, it's uncomfortable and made me feel like an outcast. Jokes on them, I usually tip 40-60% because I own a restaurant and know how hard the front of the house works.","2016-10-11","1","bqDFZDfDPdCut0CbybDUrA","q9jZUebCdCEOXYPsuTdVJQ"

"I would give the Q a solid 3 of 5 stars. I had the wings and mac and cheese and a side of deviled eggs. The wings themselves were pretty good but the jerk sauce is definitely some crappy store bought concoction. The wings were a better than average size. The mac and cheese well lets just say its not. A greesy oily clump of noodles with burnt fried cheese on top. Yeah its that bad. The deviled eggs are definitely not your grandma's eggs but hey at least the plate presentation was on point.","2016-03-02","0","gHMkTOvq89eNuVxnpF444w","7gr43o1AijunYd5h1gKrmQ"

"Love this place. Vibe is always positive and music is always good. A venue for having a drink and listening to some jams. Usually too loud to carry on a conversation so not good for a first date unless you both love music. Only tried some of the food but everything I remember was delicious. 'Popcorn shrimp' is actually popcorn with shrimp in it - cute. Hesitant to give a positive review because I love how I always get a seat...

"I really enjoyed The Lodge. I was visiting Toronto for my birthday and visited this place a few times. I enjoyed the mix of beer on draft. I had the burger and wedge fries with gravy to dip on the side for bunch\/lunch. The meat was cooked nicely and the gravy and fries were nice. The next time stopped in I had the black pepper and lime fries as a snack; which were really good.  

The staff is really nice. They are friendly and engaging. They make a point to get your name and use it.  Stop on by!","2016-04-09","0","bgOuVLRKOPla_iyXsqk4pQ","KrJsqR9hvo6uhoOjFzRf5w"

My husbands pizza was expensive and not great and my friends pizza was so spicy he couldn't eat it.  The 2 servers were not very attentive. They were at the bar on their phones.  It was just a crappy dining experience.  It's also very expensive so we will not be going back.","2017-06-18","0","3ffpa2xSDjK4XhF2E-jp1A","yPNyZPjnh7uzk3cezvpE4w"

If you are not into the whole dancing, loud music and enterainment scene, go on a Sunday for lunch or early on Friday\/Saturday night (before 10pm). Great service and the waiters are very attentive.

"DO THIS!! Always ask for the optional salt pepper lime sauce. Try dipping the seafood in their captain's boil sauce then dip a bit in the salt pepper lime sauce. Do this for every bite. Something with the combination of savoury,  sweet, sour,  and spicy makes your taste buds go bananas with every bite!","2015-12-05","0","bLtC8xJXkd1b6MT0KjnSvw","0NqTpMMl-3gkk8yiryvdJw"

If you're going to make your patrons wait that long, you really should consider applying a discount to the bill to show your loyal costumers that this is a transition issue, and it's being addressed to better serve them.

"We were excited about Foxy given its critical acclaim, but we were disappointed. The food was fine, but nothing to write home about. Our cocktails were good, but not very creative. Neither was the menu. The service was... VERY attentive. Maybe awkwardly attentive. All said, I would say that Foxy is an OK, high-end neighborhood spot, except it is OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced.

This recently opened restaurant, provides a lounge\/club vibe in tandem with great food and service.
Chef Geno and Staff are fabulous! 
Although the evening temperature proved too cold to open the outside dining area, we look forward to dining al fresco on our next visit.

"Did you know they do not allow children inside the restaurant?  Children are only allowed on the outside patio like a dog.  My kids have eaten inside herringbone in La Jolla and Santa Monica and they love it.  My kids eat off the adult menu, are well behaved, and are not allowed to use ""I-devices"" at the table.  They are better behaved than most adults. They eat better than most adults.  I think it's a despicable rule.  Get over yourself, herringbone.","2016-05-30","0","-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg","OZhd5DlD4hfDjjIwaiVSlw"

"Favorite new restaurant! The quality of food and the service is outstanding. My husband and I took advantage of the ""It Takes Two"" special, 2 entr√©es and 4 cocktails for 50 bucks. What a deal. The   Grilled Chilean Salmon was so very very tasty. We ordered the cocktail Bees Knees...YUM! Love Natalie, great server, super nice.

Combine that with bacon\/jalape√±o waffles and real Maple syrup and you've got a winner!  Staff is friendly and the decor is beautiful.

"It's a small menu of udon, Don, appetizers and drinks. But so far its really good. I've been 3 times but this time I see its becoming popular and no longer getting the restaurant to ourselves.

"I know a lot of people who prefer chatime or coco over BR but to each their own, and this right here is my go to place! I live in Etobicoke and I go to the one at Hurontario once a week, so having this place as another option is really great. Came here 2weeks after they opened and everything isn't available yet, but as long as they have the black diamond chiller I don't really care.  I don't think they will have food option anytime soon tho.","2016-06-09","1","_PqvLxLW1uZJlJZzGMWErQ","NoA61EV7Br4cmazpQDr2CA"

Water we finally got, forks not. Somehow one order of soup was left off our order so I had to wait while the rest of my family ate.  Not a big deal but a little apology would have gone a long way.

She doesn't realize that when you work for someone that pays you, you have to respect them or you get fired from where you work.  So that's why I love coming here at Today Nails because they get the best employees to work for them. Nancy is a great employee because she does a great job on my pedicure.","2016-03-24","0","JkncPZ1jFi0_n23Ptl8jGQ","RfOpxc5XM0T0ey3PR7ys4w"

"Heard rave reviews about this place, so stopped in to grab a quick breakfast. Got a ham, egg and cheese croissant sandwich, side of fruit, orange juice combo and a chai tea latte. The sandwich was ok, nothing special, the fruit iMessage in ripe and crunchy, juice was good and the latte lacked flavor.. Had had much better at Dunkin Donuts surprisingly. For $12, I'm unsure if I'll return.","2016-02-09","0","mVr_62FJXajH7u44pyBIOQ","0Fugg7nd-6mbdYVMNNpwtA"

"M&J Eastside Deli has great pastrami sandwiches and their burgers are fantastic. Everything is made in-house. The pastrami is cured on site. The burger meat is ground when an order is placed and is cooked to perfection. The fries are cut from whole potatoes and even the bread and buns are homemade. Check the hours though as they sometimes change. Seating is also sometimes limited. In spite of that, M&J gets 5 Stars from me. Try the pastrami.  You'll love it.","2017-01-28","0","ORp9PRTDtalvEGL19Wco-Q","67rF7Sq_ooUirc6kcFW6MQ"

Now that it is starting to get warm again I figured I had better call someone out. I asked a friend , she referred Enix Mechanical. I am so glad! They responded to my call in a very timely manner, came out assessed the problem and fixed it.

"I came in to get a green drink recommended by my massage therapist to supplement my treatment. Helps the body re-energize. I talked to Samantha and she was kind enough to go over various ingredients so we could decide which would be best for my body's quickest recovery. We decided on the Green Drink. So excited to have found this wonderful healthy alternative. Quick, easy and good for you. Did I mention delicious!

"Sitting in the area for an oil change, i parked at 10:04 it is now 10:15 as i write this. Only one elderly gentleman came up to me and said to move my car to the other aisle and someone would come out right away. Still no one has come up to me other than that guy. And now i sit in my car waiting for someone to come up as i was told they would.... wow! And to think the car salesmen sold me on the free year of oil changes but i gotta apparently put up with this type of treatment each time.","2017-03-02","0","8cnQ83CfH6xukclMCec-Kw","x5Y27oQXtNoqjOA0LsTH6Q"

"Ordered their chicken, spaghetti and corn.  The chicken was really juicy and i was salavating for a taste, sadly though there was no taste, it was bland bland bland.  No salt even.  The corn tasted like it was from a can and although the spaghetti portion was large, the noodles were over cooked and soft to the point of almost mushy.  In my opinion, not worth the hype and if you want flavour go elsewhere.","2017-08-03","0","51lFCPpAZz4t7-BrpLHf5g","yvcZN7H2pmeGXMV2pHpozw"

That's what we pay for when we invest in getting our nail done. I decided to change up my nail look so I went for the ""almond "" design and color...wow! I love the look! Please please give her a try. Let her know what you want. She is so easy to work with. She want you to be HAPPY  when you leave. If your not, she fix it.

Why i say semi self serve? well they had good attitudes and serves you food, BUT all drinks are self serve. which is not a big deal. Water is free(water bottles). I tired Lamp,Chicken wings, and Chicken Joints Skewers. Taste decent! not bad at all. Great idea on the idea of a heat table (my picture).

"Great food and coffee. I had the Red Velvet Latte and it was delish. The breakfast sandwich was great. My husband had the Cuban sandwich and loved it. He was indecisive on his coffe choice and she made him something he loved. She even made him a sample of another recommendation (The Toddy) and he loved it as well.  Great service and great food. Will definitely be back. There is also an automotive shop next door and we will be checking it out as well.","2016-08-15","0","uB2By0pTXV2JeM_CsMg7xw","V29Aobd_VWXQ5JAFe3Zb5A"

No one approaches or welcomes you to take your order so it is very easy to get lost in the shuffle. They won't think twice about casting you to the side and losing your business.

"If you like realllly sweet tasting donuts, their original flavor donuts (like chocolate glazed for example) aren't your best bet.

"Yes, its a little small. Perfect for lunch though.

It was like a less greasy, less salty five guys. Flat top grilled, a good crust on the meat, welldone throughout but not dry.

The toppings added a freshness that was welcome, and I wasnt falling asleep at my desk from eating too heavy.

Fries were crispy, salty. Not my very favorite, maybe not even up to the burger's standard but still tasty. But the jalapeno aioli more than rescued them.","2016-08-11","0","li0sU2BBM6P8B5u5-RRCMA","yeviL062OUk-CjileTr2Pw"

"Aqua Wave is the best! Super clean, no pun intended, the staff is helpful and nice. They actually like what they are doing in helping everyone and they don't act like it is ""just a job"". David, the owner, is probably the nicest owner you would ever meet. He offered to vacuum my car anytime I didn't feel like doing it. Come on!!! This is service, y'all. Free vacuums, free mat cleaning machine and the light show is better than a Dave Matthews Band concert!!","2016-03-27","0","1h0aNxlPTaCz2LGSkv0Nkw","Z4Qpk2hf_mNrcmdNJhCp3Q"

"Was so looking forward to trying this restaurant! It was mildly disappointing. We waited nearly 60 minutes for our food and while the beer and mixed drinks were great, I'm quite sure my McMurray Ranch Pinot Noir was not as advertised. The fried cod was undercooked, the baked cod overcooked. The cinnamon butter was delicious as was the coleslaw!

Don't listen to Yessita M's. review! The food is the best in  Cave Creek\/Tatum Ranch and has been since they opened in March.

The service was incredible and David our waiter took great care of us along with Ryan the director of beverages.  Ryan recommended an Italian beer I had never heard.
I had the pesto ravioli and my wife had the lemon risotto.  The ravioli was amazing and would definitely recommend it!

"I made a reservation for two on short notice and the staff was very accommodating. I had the 60 minute Thai combination massage. My massage therapist was Nina and she did an excellent job. She used just the right amount of pressure so that you felt it but not so much that it would be too painful. I was very satisfied with the massage and I am looking forward to coming back soon.","2016-05-16","0","o4nn1EZU39fE7zMuCy_XiA","LvEpVkdpji-JqyGYGwkLbw"

"Love Chompies Scottsdale, Tempe, Paradise Valley. Arrowhead is having some serious growing pains. Been there 6 times in the past 6 months. Only once did it meet the standard set by the founders. Never offered the pickle tray - a nice touch at other locations. So, I asked but only once did it arrive. Food order often wrong. Example, ordered lean corn beef, paid extra but didn't get it. Service is slow. I'm a big fan so I'm not giving up yet. Hopefully the owners will stop by to straighten out.","2016-12-27","0","lepAu9fXw5R93v0b6mj3vQ","Aa_gN5ytXmEDGfa1ZJa9OQ"

"I ordered the durian ice cream without knowing the price and was shocked to learn that it was $10 for a small scoop. Since I'm a huge durian fan, I was excited for it but I was UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED.

There was moderate Durian flavour but the consistency was more like slush. There were icy chunks of durian and a watery base.

On top of that she didn't let my friend order with me despite the fact that we came together.

"Costumer service here is really bad, i stood up and left after the food was served, the pictures on the menus don't belong the the restaurant. What i ordered was not the same as shown on the menus picture. The waiter told me they did not have what the picture shows even though the first waiter said they had it when i placed the order. They got into an argument with me even though i am the customer and did not offer to change my plate. So as i said i just left and i will never comeback","2016-05-05","0","K2WJ-BPzzmP9cVIImvai6g","ahNWB3UQdcjeavSV6FvwsA"

"Even though the staff was very nice and attentive I think this place is a sham. I was referred by my attorney and I had to have an emergency back surgery so I had very little treatment done and at the end of my case I found out that they charged an outrageous sum for that treatment. I have never been in a car accident resulting in injuries before so I believe they took advantage of my naivete.","2017-09-04","0","uMx6tVSFkizydL3y0ADd_A","L9yEjaaHrediHK4rF3VLOA"

"New restaurant, so I go try. oh my god, food tastes horrible, I thought there would be a lot of beef options, but there was only 4 types of beef choice. There was only 1 page of choice. We ordered 5 plate of mushroom, they gave us 1 plate, we ordered 7 plate of mushroom again, and they gave us the same portion. 
The worst thing is they force you to pay 12% tips. The table next to us refused to pay that 12% service fee and called the cops. Service is ok but you cannot focus me to pay.","2016-05-09","0","1cGgVvEbuBlW2GDvJ112vA","liAou56JVsNNyDJHSfrNeA"

"The Alley is amazing. End of story. If you like milk tea, the royal no. 9 milk tea which is subtly infused with blueberry adds so much subtle flavour and complexity to the traditional bubble tea formula that I've found it very hard to go anywhere else.

I personally like the Pear so much, it tasted exactly like a pear! Not even lying!! Also, the price is always $5 which is very reasonable and worth it! TRUST ME! Everyone would fall in love with it instantly once you have tried this place!

You can choose from vegetables, meat and seafood, pastas and a variety of sauces. Your selections are combined with your choice of sauces and grilled on a large circular grill.

"Was here about 3 months ago, the selection of items was lacking (how can you be out of spinach and crimini mushrooms), quality of what they did have was at best average. I have been following the comments about them ever since and I'm not getting warm fuzzies. They keep changing their hours too, conflicting open hours on websites. I predict that it is only a matter of time and this place will be a memory. Sad because the concept is great, but correct delivery of that concept is mandatory.","2017-06-10","0","YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw","HN64_tkiHJhVc3hT1AR-tw"

"Taste BUZZ introduces you to unique flavor profiles with a spin on traditional favorites. Make sure you bring water or something to drink. You'll be walking quite a bit. And even though it won't seem far you'll need to hydrate, especially if it's warm weather. Oh and last but not least.

"They have some really good stuff here! The lobby has a comfortable feel to it as well. The bud tenders are knowledgeable & friendly. The only down fall about it at times is, while in the show room, for some reason they always skip people. I got skipped a couple times while there. Also, another down fall is whenever I get a pre-roll (maybe it's just me) but it's poorly packed, ripped, or the weed is coming out. Still love the products. There is just some wiggle room for improvement. :)","2017-10-19","0","yeiS_cpJyxMYuYtBPxkYyA","o2le7wscgPa8viG7878zFw"

"Disappointing that a locksmith advertising auto rekeying would turn down a customer with cash, car-title, and ID in hand with a 3.5 day timeframe. That they declined to cut a most basic solid key shows the aim is to make money off service out-calls. Or that their website is false. Or that they're simply too lazy to make money. Who knows?? Cool goofy stuff on the walls, though! Loved the Back 2  The Future hoverboards","2017-09-12","0","c510a8BhWa5xaR7DJqrHqQ","UJmZA1YIwk4NlyrH0z2SAA"

"This is my absolute favorite frozen dessert shop in the greater Charlotte area.  The flavors are fantastic, the prices are fair, the offerings are all homemade on sight, and the local family who owns it are so friendly!

Pro-tip:  Ecuadorean sorbetto is the same as Italian, but Ecuadorean gelato is dairy-free.  The gelatos were  just as rich and creamy as gelatos I've had with dairy, so you wouldn't know it had no fat and very few calories unless they told you.","2017-07-14","0","CAy7twD5McMiNrkFWOUn7g","gt-m4PiUfTPGjIgB9UhjQQ"

"Least professional chipotle I've ever seen. The wait averages about 30 minutes.  I think this is because the employees are dancing, singing, and really having a great time goofing off in full view of all of the patiently waiting customers.  If there are 5 people behind the counter, typically 2-3 are dancing and chatting it up, leaving 2-3 employees to handle the long lines alone.  Every time.

"I brought my son here for his first haircut and had a good experience. I made an appointment a few months later for a second haircut online. I made the appt for 10 am on Saturday and there was no one there when we arrived and the door was locked! The sign printed on their door said open from 9am-6pm, so I'm not sure why no one was there but it was disappointing. I Had to take my business elsewhere.","2017-02-11","0","keiJDnPLIQcHur6AeYIZAQ","y_oWOLoPDn0rIAQfqMvi3g"

Also, our table was right between the bar and wait station with the traffic pattern right next to it. Felt very noisy and like we were in the middle of a train station.  They were out of several beers on the menu. My husband loves this place, but I'd rather not return. They did comp me for the M&C.","2017-05-10","0","CvonRhKDJaH155xhtpz_iw","gRSTIXOtF-9SO7YaNigDFw"

I went to the Apple Store and they turned me away and I tried to get a replacement phone from my provider and that didn't work either.

The cold turkey pesto sandwich I ordered came as a hot Panini and was actually very delicious, but if you are expecting a cold sandwich be sure to ask them not to put it into the Panini maker, thereby making it hot.

"Went in for a quick take out order. Ordered the halibut fish & chips combo. The service was great, everyone was friendly and I was in and out relatively quick. 

Now in terms of the food itself, the fish was mediocre at best, the fries on the other hand were horrible! They tasted like burnt paper mixed in with old oil, just a horrible overall taste.

I'd say skip this one and try another fish & chips joint.","2016-08-14","0","hbfrNa3AtaR0cCU0myREPA","5iANfKEFe4L_y9M1liMPcw"

"Don't come here! In my entire life, this was by far the poorest service I've ever received at any restaurants, in the world. Perhaps they were severely understaffed, but we were neglected and ignored to the point it was just disrespectful. And I did not appreciate the servers' attitudes while I was still being polite. Food is mediocre and not even decently priced. This is my first and last time here. Go ANYWHERE ELSE for Korean BBQ and sushi in Phoenix area.","2017-03-12","0","YyvpjiXO_lQuZxn6wqoPJw","Iz5G1--AB8Tgyji-LNdoLQ"

Also, when it comes to stage, dancers that don't have a license, can't take any clothing off, and new girls don't know what to do. If you ever go back ask for jewels, Julie, autumn, Mary Jane, or Dakota. I've seen them dance, they take clothes off, very nice, and they don't ""rip you off"".

"Management needs help on how to  handle customer issues. The way she spoke to me was not professional, Her Tone and her Attitude towards the issue was ""GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"" NOT customer service friendly at all. I was shocked because I have gotten my nails done here in the past.  Kathy you need a training course on how to treat your customers especially since you are the manager, you messed up your nails tech TIP$. I will NOT spend my hard earned money here any more.

I had Spanish omelette which was okay but the coffee was cold (may be because it was on the house that day) and when I mentioned it is cold the server got defensive and said it was just made.

"The one in Columbus is awesome! So we were excited that they were opening one here! Quality was great at first, but has gone downhill.  Food isn't quite as tasty and much to my disappointment, they changed their fries.  They used to be thin and crispy and were a must have every time I ate there. Now they are thicker and mushy.  They are fine but nothing amazing about them.  They also changed their point system, causing us to lose 300+ points.  They never followed up after we complained.","2017-12-02","0","zc0sUY7iWuJB93AHWKy_xw","z-13FoXWp5CB_fxHTHuNrw"

Not only do they offer a burger wrapped in lettuce (not bread), but chef prepared it exactly the way I imagined--well done, tender and juicy. It's hard to find that combination anywhere.

"This is not the only website that gives this business a bad review. Check out BBB (Better Business Bureau). This website rates businesses based on how well they treat their clients and how well they do as a business. Dalewood is not BBB credited and has a poor rating from all their clients. There's not one positive review about them. A lot of the clients have had such a hard time getting their money back. In my situation, they stole money from me, they charged me for services that I never got.","2017-05-09","0","SQ20UhQM86YTjiZSnIrojQ","I3Z3rVVyBEPoQWtcUh-_sQ"

"Back again last night to get a drink in the bar. Lani the bartender has a personality- yeah! Actually talked to my wife and I, made great mules and knew the food ingredients too. The place is spot on for a quality meal. The compressed watermelon salad- huh?- well it's awesome! Lite but tasty and so refreshing. Colleen had the scallops- cooked perfect. If it wasn't such a great spot, I could avoid it- but I can't...","2017-08-25","0","siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g","6rVzPq-WgiQTz4tpcvgf1w"

"Just go for drinks. Food quality and service can fluctuate wildly depending on time of day, but if you sit at the bar, order drinks and maybe an app while watching a game, you'll have fun. The patio is nice, but realize that they are usually blasting commercial country songs through the outdoor, sometimes making conversation difficult. But if that's your jam, then this patio is a rather pleasant place to have a few beers.","2017-08-26","0","0kzPQQL8wVcHlBQzMdRdWQ","D3ubzB6RdOiMwJ6JFIL2Zw"

Do walk-in or take your gamble.      *Honestly, OTHERWISE, they have decent pizza. Try their Canadian bacon. Also: cinnamon dessert is AMAZING, cheese &bacon bread is great if you get extra pizza sauce.","2017-01-22","0","-Ggr1M22MxTbP2J8L7oHqw","-qZuhM_sz4opDCWkG6LNEA"
"Not a full halal selection, they have 6 items to choose from which are extremely overpriced. $4.99\/lb for beef round???? This is typically $2-$3\/lb at any grocery store. Plus we always have to wait for a butcher for at least 5 minutes. They are always out of packaged halal meats, I guess we need to shop at the beginning of the week? The butcher insisted we try their kalamata olives, which were horribly brined and too salty. Just awful.","2017-07-30","0","Xrx33FtlglUKgjR3S8Qehg","6rmGr9xl_mOPSO8pxn-m8w"

"Take the secret stairs, between the cafe and main store 'up.' Be pleasantly surprised. Chill and dine in the upscale, industrial lounge, featuring wide screen TV's, casual seating, wifi and a bar!

The smaller, yet complete menu features a lighter fare of appetizers, (try one of their cheeseboards) soup, salads, (highly recommend the fresh caught salmon) and sandwiches. Very reasonably priced. The bar features lovely assortments of wines and a great assortment of beers from Triptych Brewing Co.","2016-10-23","0","-A4suUjxa7gNaiUMDjO42g","vEDr35Kmt6f3pba6q1Y1bg"

"Woohoo, this is an awesome place.  We purchased prime rib for Christmas dinner and it was awesome. Roni is great about helpful tips and recipes. We stopped in the other day for meat for stew, Roni helped out and we left with the fixings for beef bourguigon. I left with pork belly for flavor, beef meat, and an absolutely killer marrow broth. We have never been disappointed. The beef bourguigon was awesome.  Make sure to stop by The Meat Market and don't forget to stop by Brix wine shop next door.","2017-01-21","0","8cx6pcaVgEZnS3edoYvImw","e8OGL09MhFvi2-pf_WAyhg"

"We have been going to the macchiato's on the strip for many years and the food has been consistently good. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this Maggiano's in downtown Summerlin. We have been there twice and unfortunately twice we've been disappointed. I have ordered two dishes that were supposed to be served with a spicy tomato sauce. Both times I got a pink sauce not read and neither time was it spicy. My husband ordered baked ziti that had only a little cheese on top.","2016-11-26","0","wXRhRfnXaV_icpT5P8r9pg","8DC6BKnIKxsSR6a8wNYqsg"

"Not a good start for this restaurant.  The wait for our food was very long - the waitress disappeared and then got the tickets wrong.  The steak was ok - Longhorn on WT Harris much better!  My son in law was supposed to meet us but he got frustrated with the lack of parking and went home - probably a good decision.

The problem is that he is wearing gloves at the register and then (with the same gloves) goes directly to prepare drinks perhaps food, as well).

"Don't waste your money. Most expensive car wash in town that time and time again has not provided nearly what we've paid for. 29$ every time to have to supervise the guys to wipe down the steering wheel, wipe down the seats, etc. Unorganized and chaotic with all the guys running from car to car and nobody actually 2 seconds to look at what they're doing.

"I stopped in at 11am when they opened and ordered the Morris Raman. I was the only customer at the time and had a good conversation with Morris about Raman.  Really nice guy.  

I prefer this Raman more than the other Raman places I've tried in town.  Saltiness is just right.  Noodles were good.  My favorite part of the bowl is the pork belly.  Super tender.  

I asked Morris what else I should order the next time I dropped by and he recommended his favorite: Miso Raman.","2017-06-09","0","Woqed5Fw95J6oEZxIHiBgg","MPdgBB1CfE0JEtfo7Ok0Vg"

Spicy food and the unique  herbs that  they used. If only I can get the recipes that would be nice but I doubt it lol..  It's highly recommended guys!!!","2017-01-13","0","mBFGYVLh588BrvfmGsOhrA","FRXj640KMuF9sMiq_4dAFw"

Towards the end of the venue, there is a room that is called ""the library""  that has a in built fireplace. Great room to have a few cocktails w friends or for a meeting. Craft cocktails are all fresh and created by a well known mixologist.

"I really wanted to love this place.But there was nothing about it that makes me want to return.   The waitress was slow and had an angry demeanor. When our food arrived the bacon, which I had requested to be cooked extra crispy, was not cooked. It was so uncooked as to be unhealthy. I couldn't eat it.
My husband said his ham was ok, his orange juice watery and his biscuits and gravy nothing special. 
For this breakfast we spent $27 for two of us.

"I regret ever going to this place. They do not return phone calls and don't do what they say. They have no interest in ""making things right"". I feared for my life and retaliation when having a conversation with someone who said he was a manager. It is NOT worth it going to a cheap carwash like this. (They are not affiliated with COSTCO, a store that actually cares about its customers).

Maybe they used Chinese spicy oil to create the taste, since the top of broth shows the same oily film. The presentation is very lacking....the spinach were just thrown on top.  I wanted ramen and was so unsatisfied with the taste here that I looked up another ramen restaurant in the area to eat again right away.","2017-05-20","0","mIzlYJ0n8cXIHs1JiPN8kg","2HOTHueIODZ4QWc-kSiuWw"

She talked me into leaving my old school pink and white French and into trying Ombre French Acrylics. IM SO GLAD I DID! I absolutely love how the turned out! It's a natural look with a touch of glam!

"This is my first time at the poke spot. I've been to a similar concept. But this was a great experience. We love to find a place healthy with fresh food. There are so many choices especially with sauces (not a bad thing) but they will help you perfect the sauce your pallet craves.  let you taste combinations perfect sauce for your likings I ordered the miso soup today . They added seaweed, tofu? But I would add green onion. The owners\/managers take pride in what they do. Welcome to Grayhawk!!","2017-07-01","0","vA7gCRT0JsgSYy0U8NY0nA","QelWJxn862za5lVXfvCJcg"

"There should be one main entry.  The Host cannot always be outside\/ visible when coming in through the other entrance as was the case when we entered.  We walked into the restaurant lost before a timid worker finally approached us.

Secondly, the goblets are $30 each and the kids really want these drinks. Yes, they can be made without alcohol but someone should come up with a more reasonable size and price point.  I get the concept but I guess you're marketing the restaurant for adults.","2017-08-03","0","-oUM2uISux96lMGeawHIOA","Lo-Jl6upzjX7Pvkn2r0IYQ"

It's made of cheap plastic and broke in the same spot twice, I had to BUY a new bumper and then that one broke. It's such a problem that they actually sell replacement bumpers, they don't replace them you have to buy a new one for $6 every time it breaks.

"My wife and I went on a weekday night. We arrived at 430. The hostess asked if we had a ""reservation"". We did not. She then informed us that the entire restaurant was booked with reservations. She also never asked if we wanted to sit in the bar, so we assumed there was nothing there as well. We then left and went to the adjoining art gallery for about a half hour. We were curious, so we checked back into the restaurant at 5. No extra customers were seated in the restaurant. We were not happy...","2017-05-18","0","xaFzCJe82C4N7t4zeCo3hA","lyAzWKLVeYFJuKXc006pVQ"

"First time trying it. The minute I walked in I was greeted by the owner. She was super nice and welcoming. The tacos are hands down one of the best I've had. Meats are marinated with lots of flavor! The place is super clean and well organized. The salsas remind me of my Moms home cooking. I will definitely recommend this place and continue  to visiting.

"Very disappointing visit to their new location.  We had gone several times to their original location and the cookies were delicious.  We decided to try their new location on Friday because we read that they would be serving coffee to go along with their cookies.  Needless to say, that wasn't the case.  No coffee.  No working bathroom.  My all-time favorite cookie, chocolate chip, was small, overpriced at $1.99, and tasted like it came from a bag of Chips Ahoy, which probably would taste better.","2017-04-15","0","mVomtOMgBxbGvdPSaF2HjQ","Itwv3ycYgVk8LF4uW-W6cg"

"D√âGO√õTANT Au debut ils vous disent qu'il y a dix sortes de viandes √† go√ªter mais le service est extr√™mement lent et vraiment mal organiser Les viandes sont tllmnt sal√©e et de plus elles ne sont pas du tout bien cuite Par contre les serveurs sont tr√®s gentil et agr√©able. 48$ de gaspiller un des pires resto que j'ai visit√© jusqu'√† maintenant. Gaspillage d'argent mais aumoin l'ambiance est bonne avec la danseuse br√©silienne, c dommage que pour 400 personnes il y avait seulement une seul danseuse .","2017-05-24","0","Xl2LzZ7AKZA5uSdCmdOluA","3Q7x_sUOG12RTvkMdG_SnQ"

Next door is a old man with terrible service who doesn't care about business.  I would try him out.

But I ordered a breakfast sandwich at a donut shop. I also got a buttermilk bar and a apple fritter. DELICIOUS, I by no stretch of the imagination a donut snob. But growing up with donuts from the grocery store this place hit all the right points for me. I will be back.

"This is place amazing. I went to Las Vegas for a conference and was exhausted at the end of the week. Massages around The strip is way overcharged. So I tried Sawasdee. 90 min of combination massage was definitely a good treat to my body. Good technique, very reasonable price, professional staff & relaxing atmosphere.

"Tried it today for the first time today. The food was bland and mediocre and definitely didn't live up to the hype. The plate comes with chopped up iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and didn't include the usual tabule, pickled turnip, pickles, onions and no garlic sauce. I don't know if the white sauce was watered down hummus or tahini. One thing that lived up to the name was the hot sauce, it is hot!","2017-05-08","0","xL9EhlYVMSe2mdkisYjXog","SI1IdtXtMz5eAW5oSvsj3Q"

They were able to do everything we needed from landscaping, irrigation and lighting.  Whenever I've texted or emailed Luis he has gotten back to me within the hour.  
Not only was the service exceptional but their prices can't be beat!  I can't say enough good things about Luis!

"Eat it the same day if you can! It is a lot tastier to eat it fresh than chilled. It also tastes a lot more like an egg tart and less like a cheese tart if it is chilled.

The desert was so sickeningly sweet no one at the table ate it. The food was a vegan menu but they didn't tell us that.

Free roasted peanuts with Chili and Szechuan ""numbing"" peppers was my only enjoyable ""numbing"" pepper experience so far. Very tasty. 

Menu prices are really low, like the vegetarian dishes are under $8. The point is to try more than one dishe. It's a ""noodle bar"", not a ""choose your entr√©e"" restaurant. Every item is recommended.","2017-11-15","0","o4gB1zWiCHgbjq-tNFRW-g","jFy4tX2i8NjzWnuyuB7i8Q"

"First time visiting this place and did not like it one bit. 1st off they didn't honor their promotion on restaurant.com.  I was suppose to get $25 off on a $50 tab. The waitress and manager seem to not know the promotion. He had to call the owner, Frank, which he didn't honor the deal. Instead, he offered me 20% off I was like that's not the same as the promotion. Their food is way over priced. They say they sell sushi but it's not on the menu.

One plate at a time 3rd- Food was nothing to talk about. No shrimp. No pulled pork. Fried mushrooms cost me 9.00!! 4th- No Ac. It was hot! I can say the poor server tried her best but overall.hot mess!! And the hot sauce bottle had so much crust around the top we refused to use it.I hope they learn fast before they are shut down.","2017-11-11","0","KaUB34enSO-stij40-n9dQ","XGeRa1YOiM1yCmjT2SJZkw"

"Totally agree with Nicole L.  The vermicelli was way over cooked and I they didn't use the traditional thin vermicelli; they used the thick vermicelli. Also ordered a young coconut on the hope that it'd be fresh. It didn't taste too bad but they didn't cut it well enough. I was left picking pieces of coconut out of the juice like I eating fish with bones. Overall would recommend for an average Viet meal. Not blown away by any means.","2017-10-01","0","HT_eV18wKa8WzCz8UsTVZA","6ifce5dqWkYyOEI6NA1yvw"

"Huge fan of Kimpton- came for Merchant and Trade, but were told we needed reservations. Went to dinner instead. Service was spotty but it's opening night.  Queen City salad delicious, full of flavor.  Branzino crudo -very strange dish, components never melded together and I LOVE crudo!!   Husband's risotto ok, lacked flavor and not really risotto, just rice with a leek sauce.  Shared broccolini, overly salty taleggio cheese & too much salt- broccolini way over roasted (burnt, really)","2017-11-01","0","CV05rBOr5DdDGvxUZkRFmg","hIHqsskaLCBSgUzBePus8w"

Just the right amount of spice.  You cannot go wrong eating at this quaint cafe!!!","2013-09-20","0","966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA","GdO51FEGpNUs71CCUT7GBw"

"Place is OK
Large menu borders on pho, soups , chow meins
-mussels in basil -ok...nothing special 
-chefs spicy chicken...ok...not spicy really...just a bunch of pepper pods
-beef chow fun...like beef stroganoff in gravy Chinese style
...looking around almost everyone was having soups so maybe that is their forte?","2014-02-14","0","966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA","uEliLGL42i4bzW1SYX89Rg"

They are very personable and professional. Danny remembered me when I came back for my fill. The place is immaculate inside, modern and clean, I neatly fell asleep on the comfortable bed (even gave me a blanket) while Anna did my lashes.
I am blown away from the finished product. Looks amazing, natural and beautiful. Highly recommend this place, I signed up for the membership 
which discounts refills. 
BRAVO!! Well done Deka Lash","2017-11-25","0","vrLCCbflX3zRHx2jo0cfXg","nfHS7A0wfbRZPJKRC4yluA"
