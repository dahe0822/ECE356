"Tried Bootleggers for the first time last night. Food was very good and fresh. Had the bacon board and nachos for an appetizer. Both were amazing! 

After those heavy appetizers I had the cobb salad for my entree. It was also very good, very fresh!

My only complaint were the drink prices. $9 for a low ball jack and coke? We are not talking gentlemen jack or single barrel! Regular jack $9? Last time I paid that price was at the Phoenician Resort. Take note Bootleggers, I won't drink there!","2013-06-25","0","2skQeu3C36VCiB653MIfrw","SpwI8V8F199kF1s2i1PpZA"

"I'm a fan of Cabela's. However, today we had a encounter with a not so customer service oriented employee. 

My nephew asked a employee where to go for a refund, when he did not receive credits for tokens used at the shooting gallery. The sales associate was helping another customer. 

My issue is how the employee responded. His response was "" Do you mind, can you see I am helping someone, you need to wait"". 

I understand having to wait. What I do not appreciate is curt responses.","2014-12-27","0","-qxj-HqHo2tcK-jQVjAp1g","MMf0LhEk5tGa1LvN7zcDnA"

"Can't even give it a 1.  Service was horrible.  I ordered a couple rolls and wife and son had already finished their dishes before the chef yelled over to me that it was done. Also, we asked several times for eel sauce and to no avail without a response.  Waitress seemed to discuss this with the chef but waitress pointed at chef as if it was his issue.  The chicken Katsu was overly breaded and my wife's tempura plate, well, sucked.  My advise, seriously, don't go there!!!!!

"I called and spoke to someone who answered the phone, ""Hello"". I had to ask if I'd reached an antique store.  Then I asked if he carried antique percolators (coffee) to which he replied, Our products are much older than coffee pots honey. I think but don't say, Well ""buddy"" check Wikipedia. The percolator was invented in 1810!!!!   

""The percolating coffee pot was invented by physicist Sir Benjamin Thompson between 1810 and 1814 following his pioneering work with the Bavarian Army","2015-08-15","0","w0_TJFB7_m1XpGQHaKfe6Q","x5sY4OsuR9l93hQ3xR4pIA"
