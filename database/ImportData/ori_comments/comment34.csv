"By far the BEST crepes in town!! We wanted a good and affordable breakfast and we got that! The owners wife is the one doing the crepes and since we got front row seats at restaurant she allowed me to take pictures. I recommend ""The Monkey"" with strawberries. Soooo dee-lishous!! This will be my must stop breakfast location! A+++++ service, food and ambiance : )","2013-12-29","0","HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g","r92KMtkGvl13NmIUYttGOQ"

"Wouldn't recommend this place. Friendly staff, cute place but overall poor quality. I asked for an ombré like Lauren Conrad more light than dark, I left VERY unsatisfied with reddish brown hair. I came in with very light hair so I understand that the organic products would give my hair an odd ish color but it was nothing what I wanted.   I was extremely disappointed and will not be returning back or recommend this salon.","2013-09-24","0","iSpsho-bWqSz3JFcxHepuA","6i2OAwpQuaIcnZDKC-VHkQ"

"This little Mom and Pop place is the perfect place to relax. The artwork on the walls is nostalgic, as is the outstanding Thrifty ice cream and the candies which are a throwback to the good ol' days.  The burgers and hot dogs are outstanding.  Great place to take the family.  Prices and great for the quality of food produced.  Randy Walters, the owner, makes sure everyone's food is perfect and that they have a great time.  Go to TripAdvisor and write a review for this place.","2015-04-05","0","2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw","XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw"
"The menu is filled with a large variety of creatively dressed and served hamburgers and hot dogs, cooked to order.  Burgers are hand-formed and spiced, made of Nebraska corn fed, Angus chuck. DELICIOUS. Ice cream, sundaes, shakes & malted milks are available for dessert.  The restaurant has a nostalgic theme from the fifties.  Randy Walters, the owner and host welcomes every guest and makes them feel like long-time friends.  He makes up 50% of the great, relaxing atmosphere of Wimpy's Paradise.","2015-09-04","0","2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw","XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw"
"Congratulations to Randy Walters, owner and host of Wimpy's Paradise and Pittsburgh Willy's.  His Pittsburgher hot dog was ranked #21 by the New Times for the TOP 100 Entrees in the metro Phoenix area.  The Pittsburgher is a hot dog, topped with chipped ham which has been sauteed in butter, sprinkled with a bit of cheese.  This entree came in well ahead of Ted's Hot Dogs in Tempe, which made it in the top five hot dog places in the New Times' Best of Phoenix Readers' Choice 2015 nominations.","2015-09-05","0","2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw","XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw"

"Randy's food is prepared and tastes exactly as it is supposed to every time I have eaten here.  That is BECAUSE he has trained his chefs well.  His entire staff is extremely conscientious, with at least one person checking with every guest to ensure that his or her meal was prepared exactly as it was ordered.   Randy's personality and the nostalgic decor of his restaurant makes coming here a real treat.","2015-09-21","0","2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw","XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw"
"I discovered Pittsburgh Willy's when it was located inside the antique shop on Az. Ave.  My mom and I were browsing around when we caught a heavenly scent coming from a corner of that store.  We followed our noses and made two great discoveries:  1) they make the very best hot dogs on Earth, and 2) Randy Walters, the owner and host, is a very friendly gentleman from Pittsburgh.  He greets each guest like a long-time friend, and he visits with everyone to make sure their meal is a great one.","2015-09-05","0","jAl7qblSDlPoQYp5L3f3Ow","XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw"

"Came for Winterlicious. Had tiger prawn saganki, lamb shank and baklava. Get free cheese saganki with check in and watch cheese being set on FIRE! Prawns: fresh and paired well with a tomato-based sauce but it was not lit on fire table-side as its name suggested. Lamb shank: flavourful with both tender and dry parts. Baklava: good honey flavour but the texture was off. The pistachio filling was gritty and the phyllo layers were not well separated. Overall: food not special but well-prepared.","2016-02-08","0","C6vH0qzmcerMkiJy3VO9qA","zCQ8b-mkgo-qBIG9W-3DgA"

"Three separate lines, depending on which type of meat you want. Make sure to ask about that because the longest line will be for steak and if you are not there for that then make sure you let the person at the door know.
In my opinion, the steak is not worth making a long line for because there are so many other taquerias that offer the same at a cheaper price.","2017-07-03","0","RwMLuOkImBIqqYj4SSKSPg","T6ll0PL0PhHxYup3z19-Mw"

"BRING CASH!  The business thinks they are saving you money by not charging a fee to run credit (so they don't have to absorb the cost), but they are really killing their customer base in bank fees. Yes, the ATM is free on their end, but depending on which bank you use, you could be charged up to $3.50 for the convenience.

Maybe a whole 4 days....","2016-06-27","0","U4jgxAolsM7BPgrrKllnVA","AxBMYD2KH8DfhK-FDvD7pw"

"Had the oxtail and it was terrible. It's obvious many of the commenters here cannot decipher good Jamaican food. The oxtail meal was $10 and I got 4 pieces of oxtail (robbery). The gravy was so sloppy, she must use flour or cornstarch to thicken. It was gross. 

Rice and peas was dry. Even the cabbage was soggy and needed salt. Who could mess up steamed cabbage?? 

This is not the place for oxtail. I hope their other food tastes better. I won't be back to find out.","2013-06-01","0","bINwYZHW_KUWdqAlfBh_Bw","QTPjADpsMRbqLT8WAn3pTQ"

"Service was personable and sweet but that was the only good thing I can say. Ticket was $29 and change for 3 drinks and 3 dinners WITH an BOGO coupon. I was charged $2 to substitute (canned) mushrooms and peppers instead of MEAT to make a sandwich vegetarian. Portions were large but overall bland and I'm underwhelmed by the whole experience.

When we asked her to wipe off the table, she looked surprised. When she did get around to it, she left behind a used toothpick and a rumpled sugar packet. We had to flag her down when our empty beer glasses failed to get her attention. Then we never saw her again.

We were asked our food order on 3 different occasions before it arrived. Food was served after about 45 minutes. Asked for the bill when the pizzas came. They came 20 minutes later, and we were served  the wrong bill and then asked for 4th time what our food order was.

"My tip is to the people @ propeller. I'm sure you're all lovely human beings but when a customer comes in and buys a pound of coffee for the 2nd time in 3 weeks you really shouldn't treat them like a dirty bucket of vomit when they ask for a chai with a shot of espresso in it. You don't get to judge anyone because of their personal drink preferences. I promise I will never come back no matter how much I like your coffee.

Probably one of the worst experiences as a customer ever","2016-05-03","0","3KG13qMCNegGT9oIxWAAWw","PA2MNztWmRx9JBvbz9wd4A"

"My experience hasn't been anything like the reviews -- apartment is cheap, a little shabby, but commensurate with price. No bed bug problem to speak of. My biggest beef is that the free Wi-Fi is atrocious -- slow and sporadic. If you rely on Internet access, you might think about factoring in the cost of Cox (which I believe is available to individual units). There's a lot of renovation going on, hopefully they fix this problem along with the other spiffing up.","2017-07-23","0","odFtT5pqWeG-moGjvcNazw","bSnLSfsQoSOBBBEJB1WQiw"

Holley collects beans from around the world so that rocks, BUT if you want something special, try Kali's healthy cookies. If you chat ideas with her she will even create one based on your chat... And low calorie, vegan, luscious, rich, yummy treats they are!

"Hash a go go is extremely weird, their food does not look real and they charged us 6 dollars for a large orange juice each. I would have not ordered if I knew it was going to be so expensive! Also, the servers are slow and rude, when I asked for a normal looking eggs benedict, the server told me they only have what's on the menu which was the weirdest looking benedict I've ever seen. Never go here unless you want to pay 30 dollars for a mediocre meal with bad customer service","2015-01-20","0","3ajqOW9A7VhResA08I7RTg","duXGVEj4MtBSYwJPWo-_5w"

Much to my horror my lashes look horrid the tech applied to much glue so I have huge globs near the base of my eyelids and the lashes are sticking straight out no curve. I've had to pull the majority or the lashes off. She used both a cheap glue and a very cheap hard lash.","2016-07-23","0","2kT-5q2h-117H9BrF6uS3A","2tY9u4fx6F-rRiGELvjiqg"

"They are ALWAYS up selling you a premium and telling you there's things wrong with your vehicle.  I heard every line while sitting there- they told me months ago I needed new struts- took it into dealership and there was no issue.  This time brake pads- for just front brake pads at $350.  Unreal.  Stay away from them- find a loyal and honest mechanic.","2017-03-17","0","JyfQS_OoeNGBSKRUDIALvQ","f6yZQ2tmUWII6S41VZX1Rw"

"First time at ArtBurger and not impressed. I came with a friend because we found a  deal through groupon. We had the gourmet for 2 people for 25$! First off SERVICE was slow! The burger was mediocre. I would have rather gone too burger deville.the lack of attention was appealing the male waiter should be fired. He gave me so much attitude. I had asked for caramelized onions thinking they were the same thing as grilled onions.Clearly they were not. The way he responded to me was so rude.","2015-11-22","0","5c5UirXrN1UsEZiM6FGP9g","jqommpsTWWDkxwo-vgKyFQ"

"Discovered Perk Up on Yelp and want to spread the word! This place is full of love. Such a warm atmosphere, great quiet background music, and delicious coffee and food (homemade raspberry almond muffins anyone?) I've been to most other coffee shops around Vegas and I go out of my way to come here as often as possible. Their coffees are really unique- so bold and flavorful! My favorite thing to do is work on the couches by the sunny window. If you are looking for a new place, check out this gem!","2013-07-07","0","x71EvWJDVKZfM-OiYDWZ6A","1iyCpsGQDHxlM6EzHfhrSw"

"Unreliable and disappointing! I hired the owner for interior design. She charged a hefty ""consultation fee"" and took several weeks before emailing me a dozen recommendations. I didn't mind, but when it took me the same amount of time to review her many emails, she abruptly informed me she had moved on from my project and assumed I wasn't interested.  She said she would try to circle back and I never heard from her again.  I tried emailing her to remind her of our agreement and again...crickets.","2016-08-01","0","CUCXgBntRrZP4DGRgPtBuA","eQ0BeXcg-XTUP1zsojZT6w"

"Verde was awesome! The food was absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced for a more upscale restaurant. Our group of 7 had 3 appetizers, three sangria pitchers, and an entree each and only paid $30\/person (we did go on Sunday when they have discounted sangria - $5 off per pitcher).

"We were excited to find out that there was a Mongolian BBQ restaurant near us. Unfortunately, we were disappointed that many of the meats were pre-seasoned and pre-cooked. The initial bowls used for filling were small compared to the displayed bowl portions. In the end, the remaining volume was filled by a required starch. The produce choices were interesting and varied. However, when asking about the ingredients of the sauces, we were given very little information.","2013-12-14","0","QRJuF1Abui7KsH6G5ozD6g","WH9gyX9Sd4J2NCoyaU7Phw"
"This place is horrible:

1.) they have rats roaming around the store like dogs

2.) i took a quick trip on my HoverBoard to dollar tree to get 1 thing really quick and I got yelled at at the top of her lungs by an employee there in front of everyone if the store, LOUD!  (She could of kindly asked me to get off my board), then she proceeded to called me a ""stupid Bitch"" and a lot other embarrassing and rude words & she wanted to fight me,for no reason!!

"Ok so just got home from getting my nose pierced here, I went in and it was about 15 minutes till they were closing, they were very nice and were more than happy to pierce me. The piercer was very sweet and helpful and took his time with me I was very happy that even though we were cutting into his time he did not make me feel rushed. Overall awesome experience and I would definitely come back here for another piercing. I'm already planning on coming back for a tattoo. Amazing! Thanks guys!!!","2014-02-18","0","W0qvThg93fRjYuCqeS1Nsw","RoEkwmyYXUlvAO-AC8vZeg"
"Place was just a teeny bit confusing to find once in the parking lot granted it was night time but I called and right away the guy told me where to go I saw the tattoo sign my ditzy self just couldn't figure out how to get up to it.

"Don't pay attention to the Groupon reviews. These people usually don't like hot yoga and don't take the time or make the commitment to make yoga part of their life journey. You will meet many people old and young here,and there's a great group of dedicated students that follow this yoga studio as regular yoga students.

In the last 18months, I have been transferred from doctor to doctor 3 times, without notification beforehand. The staff is rude amd unprofessional.

All ready to take my credit card info by phone but unwilling to give me my medical records.

"I came here yesterday, I was not amused at all. I ordered two plates of the mixed grill and a plate of shawarma. The mixed grill tasted very bland and barely had any seasoning and the quality of the meat was not as expected, the shawarma was basically grilled chicken tenders which is not what shawarma really is. Overall I do not think this place is as advertised and is overrated.","2017-08-12","0","J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w","gVoejBJPj4XdT7kbteqmkw"

If you go on a Monday you cannot find the crab legs and the Chinese food is cold. When brought to the manager's attention she said they would bring more crab legs out ... 15-minutes later, no crab legs, no fresh or hot food and we left.

"Best hair salon in Brampton that I tried. Had my hair done by Marco; very nice guy and made me laugh. He fixed my hair that was done by a girl that seemed to be just learning and was taking orders from the owner ( this hair salon was Highlight Essence, also in Brampton) which I found very sketchy, she totally messed up my roots, they were a 2 tone blonde and not one colour (which it should be). Needless to say I wasn't impressed but Marco did a nice job and didnt over charge me! BEST PLACE 4hair","2014-08-21","0","XMf_pBT_YvlvOgfxGEdGoA","eZvm-BhX-Qt88hG33G664w"

"Before people start throwing around stupid comments like ""the PEOPLE writing THESE reviews are as sad as the lady running the scam"" (notice the use of correct English), they need to look at what their doing first.

"Sad to say 
I didn't not like this nail salon or maybe the nail tech ""Olga"" I went in for a gel mani. I had gel previously on so all the nail tech needed to do was take my old gel off. And apply new, She used the spinning electric tool to take my nail polish off but kept cutting me about 3\/4 times. I couldn't take the pain of having my fingers cut up! After me saying ouch a few times she finally put nail polish remover with the tin foil. After an hour went by I just told her I didn't want Polish","2014-01-16","0","xW4liVG78skBJloTuKz7MA","K0XHFNFtuEVLNNNGXG7UtA"

The owner was exceptional, picked us up at our hotel and was so accommodating. We mentioned we wanted to see the Las Vegas sign and he happily took us after the hot air ballon ride. They also offer skydiving off the hot air ballon, so if you're an adrenaline junky and want something new to try Do This! I promise you won't regret it.","2015-06-24","0","4VHp2gei1bpY68ZzEZE9Bg","f0GO3hAX38Mtvk41oD2Uvg"

"Do NOT RENT from them. I repeat DO NOT!! Mixed info. Deceitful customer service. They will take your money with a smile. Not customer oriented or consistent. They will transfer you to a supervisor but beware. With this place you never actually know who that is and if its the wrong person and they tell you the wrong information believe YOU will be the one who pays for it. Their mistake is your expense.","2013-11-12","0","uSVmEQp96ePH1HjIuoZe5w","0KyISjZ_JAJe8VZ3E-thgw"

As others said you think your getting a good deal and they add on soooo much more for my halway and 15 stairs which they tried to charge me for 17 due too the top stairs which are technically my hall still would cost an extra $175 thats not including my 4  bedrooms which I had a living social for total rip off!!!!","2014-05-29","0","Qfot__pJvxoVsw5uQ88Tsw","PDfBzY1sJ9jnHw3pkVrYHQ"

We were told that the tables were all reserved.  Flat out lied!!!!  When asked a second time she said it again!!!!  Food was overpriced for what u got.  Won't be going there again.  Would try them again but not after the lying and snippy attitude of the young gal who sat us.","2017-01-29","0","ZfPcpbZssIMrYBSg9jXNdw","WYFTqGGJ3mMwxLtRhddCpg"

"This is a bike themed bar that hates bikes.  Bouncers asked us not to block the bike parking area in back to make way for horses(?).  We were also asked to move from out in front of the bar because they did not like us.

""Insinuated"" is generous; It was made clear that I couldn't be trusted to pay in a typical manner, even as a returning customer. Way to treat someone paying you hundreds of dollars for a cut and colour. Call them as thieves.

I ordered a BLT my bacon was a stale and looked green my fries were not hot at all it was like my food had been sitting around for 20 min. My friend got breakfast the sausage tasted like plastic the bread was crumbly and the eggs looked like the processed eggs from McDonalds.

"I live close by so instead of going to starbucks or mcdonald's I come here.  It's cheap.  The food ain't too bad.  I like it here.  I can't complain.  It's not the best place but better than any fast food.  I come here usually between 11-12 before I do my reading at the windmill\/rainbow library.  I'll always come here unless they come up with an organic breakfast place.  Naomi one of the cashiers up front is always so nice to me and all the servers.

"This place is more-so for people who likes their cheese so thick, it slides right off the pizza, leaving you with a naked slice of bread & sauce... Pizza wasn't horrible but the buffalo chicken salad was. The chicken looked as if it was chewed on and spit out, with saliva juices full of buffalo sauce. The salad really did looked ""tossed"" and amateur... There's a billion other pizza places to try out here, so I definitely won't be stuck with ""basic"".

"I heard good things about this place. When I tried it today, I had very high hopes. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and the steamed pork dumplings. The General Tso's was alright. Mediocre really. It was clear the chicken was hand cut, and not swimming in the chemical taste you get from other places, so I appreciated that. The dumplings, however, were not good. Whatever dough they use, they use way too much of it and it overpowers the pork inside. I wouldn't order it again.","2016-06-19","0","JJi7c7uiTzCqeWNTsldgXQ","NYfZoMPn7guKYlnO_F8gUg"

"I've been tattooed by the artist Christine before and followed her to Old Town Ink because she's absolutely amazing! This shop is small and comfortable and the artists were friendly and interested in my tattoo, so I felt very comfortable. You can tell the artists care about you and your tattoo because they match each tattoo with the artist they feel will best suit that piece and style. They want to give you something amazing to walk out the door with.","2013-06-23","0","Fy1mU2z-06UsRgu88ELNOA","yCijEeiU0rj5ipJPxkHzMg"

Salad and fruit bar: pineapple from the can, and the backyard oranges.  soup choice are very basic and for low class of buffet.  the clams also full of sands. this restaurant 1-2 stars the most.

"Love all the wings. Their wing dust is the BEST! I got the buffalo chicken salad last time. It was HUGE and loaded with tender, juicy chicken. Not to hot either. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad again a few days ago, still huge  but HOLY HELL it was HOT. WOW. I had to stop midway through and drink a glass of milk and eat a piece of bread. Next time I order I'm going to request to go a tad light on the buffalo sauce. Still a killer salad though! They don't skimp on the toppings or the meat.","2015-12-28","0","zmoQ2eIDyeKlKVGA8p9esQ","7wBcX6Xt6Tb3h0rcfyym6g"

"We both went with the all-you-can-eat deal ($24.99, anything on the menu, any time, all day) and it didn't disappoint. My first round was the BBQ nacho fries, baby back ribs, beef rib, bacon potato salad and cheesy mac and cheese. The highlight was definitely the beef rib - juicy and meaty. Second round was the smoked meatloaf and another baby back rib. My husband carried death to this - three rounds - everything rocked.

"Never will I ever return. The piercer was rude and intimidating. He toots his own horn, that he's the best piercer in Montreal. I went asking for a vch, and left with a Christina. I had to go to adrenaline in order to be re pierced properly. When I called to complain, the manager was extremely ignorant, stating that 514ink and Adrenaline were apples and oranges. I explained that vch and Christina's were apples and oranges and it was unfortunate her piercer did not know where a clitoris was.","2015-08-05","0","LOLkdkAFsTvjap8oTsU7Tw","gETOoEgP5zTuGUSazb_jDA"

"This used to be my favorite place to dine being that I love Mexican food and I love breakfast! But after being informed at my last visit that the owner now refuses to serve chips and salsa my rating of them had gone down. If I am paying for a full meal with sangria and quacamole I think I deserve complimentary chips and salsa as they are a staple in every Mexican restaurant. That was a bad executive decision!

"This library is convenient because it is close to home.  I have to admit that when you come to a library you want peace & quiet.  Not here!  Nope noisiest Pinchi library I have Ever visited.  You think common sense would kick in the minds of whom work here?  No, you're hallucinating if you think they are taking control.  They too make a lot of noise & no one whispers at all!  I was tempted to drop a grenade in the middle of the building but, I doubt if anyone would notice...","2015-06-09","0","UFcpPyU1nREUWrV0oEf6VA","GdcYYuRxJ6nXKJg_P3Vr2g"

"I have to agree with the other post about this guy. My boyfriend hired this guy for a romantic meal for my birthday. We spent the entire meal talking about the big-ego'd chef who just bragged about how busy he was the entire time and how he wanted to quit and move to Vegas. The food was bland and not impressive. He cleaned which was nice. He was very rushed, and an hour and 15 mins late. Not an enjoyable experience and I don't even want to know what my boyfriend paid for this letdown of a gift.","2014-02-07","0","X4VET17jRHWs_XlNIuIlKg","p0bMdKGjZIKtct7rLQD-dQ"

"I had tried the Japanese pan fried  noddles and the Thai curry soup. The soup was tasty but the noodles in the Thai curry were undercooked. They were hard and chewy instead of soft and tender. Japanese noodles with tofu were overcooked and dry. The tofu tasted like it was cooked a long time ago. It needs to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Stick with the mac and cheese or pad thai for safe bets.","2014-05-26","0","D2nfOrnJ2OBlX_428sKyMg","IfrGYaL-5ekfLcM7xCvKSg"

"Valet parking is on Jefferson. Staff is friendly & professional at check-in, but slow to warm up to you in the bar. Complimentary wine social from 5-6pm is a nice touch. The rooftop pool (on 3rd floor) was an exquisite place to relax on such a beautiful evening. Rooms are incredibly spacious and classy. We recommend this hotel as a great place to stay in downtown Phoenix!","2014-05-23","0","WU4wM-uD1INThG6F3sGzCQ","BRPkGhWYreBf2B2SVzlyFw"

"What a disappointment since the original owners sold this place. This started off as a unique pizzeria with a bit of a New York feel to the flavours and unique za options. Owners sold and, as is often the case in this city, new owners know nothing about making fresh and rich pizza. Now it's not as clean, the pizza is dry, not enough sauce, what little there is is dried up by the time you get a pie home. Seriously sell to someone who knows how to make pizza please!","2017-02-27","0","sT9oX8vDwD9btDakUM2H5w","eqPSfFRztr3fQ5roQVia1w"

"This was my first time here and everything was wonderful! The sushi was fresh but I probably wouldn't order the uni..it wasn't bad but not the best (my personal preference). I loved the Brian roll! Yum! It was well balanced between sweet and spicy..who would of thought soy paper wrap, deep fried bananas with imitation crab, jalapeño, and eel sauce.","2013-08-05","0","Bm8nRUsZ-dK6g2eJLxMTOw","QEt0Dav4bj7lRRdiZ6mNrA"

"I started to get gel nails done where they dip your finger in the sparkle powder. I had to stop them before they finished. The tech didn't back-fill with product first. She started with gel and sparkle. Then coated the whole nail with acrylic. I asked what if wanted to change color and was told I'd have have to take them oft completely. I had her remove the sample which tore up my nail. I would never go back!","2014-05-13","0","Dsr33WiRGtR60LGzN7LI_Q","HElyLznd4JYZpJPAHVJAnw"

"Awful. Simply awful. Went in and was convinced to combine two packages I bought when I only wanted to use the haircut. Convinced me to use the highlight lowlight package too. Then I said I like my hair super dark so if I get highlights they have to be just slightly lighter brown. I have blonde streaks. They said now they can't combine the haircut. So no haircut (what I needed) and awful blonde streaks that made me cry. Now I am paying $80 at a REAL salon to get it fixed.","2013-03-02","0","Z7HE3UmDVyacXAid1VgVUQ","Htd0EhWy8sMCb9h28MMneg"

"Ive been here atleast 20 times and always great service\/environment. It's located just off whites Rd exit on 401 highway, usually clear sailing between 11-3 pm which is great for casual lunch. 

The beef brisket here has a great texture. It actually looks like it's been shaved off a larger more succulent fatty piece of beef. The head chef here is extremely passionate and you're in for a treat anytime he's here. Definitely worth a shot for barbeque and meat lovers alike.","2014-04-22","0","VugEOZbHiO-1drlhgP7Z4A","hQoDqsohE4G4J-M-W2CC6Q"

"I wouldn't bring my dogs to the dog hotel. I was buying dog food and a big dog just ran after its owner out of the store where there was a couple employees that ran after it when I was leaving I seen the dog in the parking lot with the owner. Good thing he was out there because I think his dog would have been gone had he not been out there","2017-04-18","0","shLhh3VtQGX9XkenWwPJUQ","URa1TTzEXBThDnt0JU2Ccg"

"Nandos is a popular chicken chain in the United Kingdom. The first time that I'd tried it (after hearing raving reviews from other Americans), I wasn't very impressed. But then I gave it more chances and caught on- their sauces are ADDICTINGG. Comes in ranges of spiciness and once you start, ya can't stop. Their Peri-Salted Chips is good too (compared to their regular chips) because it's full of MSG goodness which is nicely rare, as everything in the UK tends to be a bit more bland than the US.","2016-09-28","0","zVW3XeWuqg-MkSFxRKROOg","l6Oup8BhYBOI4bGrnqrGbQ"

Good enough for oil changes but when i had them do my timing belt...lets just say im paging a honda certified mechanic to fix the job right. Timing was off twelve notches...sensors apoxied together after clip broken. Had to replace wheel well housing cover after they failed to put all the clips back and got shredded by my tire.

"Likes: Room was beautiful and very spacious.4 people and in our suite we could have easily fit 10 people comfortably (using the pull out beds). There was a big kitchen in the main common area and a microwave, frig, and toaster. Queen size bed in the second room and King in the master. plus was the view  and the huge shades that covered when you wanted to close and to open. There was also a projector tin the main area. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. DEF A BANG FOR YOUR BUCK","2014-07-05","0","vnvQ0lD9MDje2DFde9PKQA","DiYMQbuXhA9u60POefzl7A"

The portions are pricy but very small. Daily specials but they can not be combined with groupons. So groupon-ers expect to pay full price for everything! Strong drinks!

I orderd a crunchy chicken Salad.
Super good!!!
I dont like fried chicken but it was amazing. 

The service was nice. Its not like a franchise resturant . It feels more like a grandmothers kitchen, and people are invited to eat, 

I walked in. I wasnt immediately greeted. The lady at tge counter was taking an order on the phone. But a man, i think the owner, he came out and asked is what we liked. He was so nice. And really took the time to help us. Love it","2013-11-21","0","h0MNaniQdLa3ZGmXh9DDeQ","hLecgQ2tiA1_8o1xmZcK4Q"

"Amanda had great recommendations & was very sweet.

Loved my espresso martini despite my terrible Asian glow. Lighting was dim w some red neon lights anyway ;)

Some red wine got on my raincoat. Amanda helped clean w club soda, which did the trick!
Asparagus soup was amazing! Oysters were fried. Prefer raw\/grilled.

Ribcap Delicious & flavorful! Bone in NY also tasty. Med rare was perfect!

I have a sweet tooth, but toffee pudding was cloyingly sweet imo

Overall, I'm so happy. Will def be back!","2017-02-18","0","OETh78qcgDltvHULowwhJg","nvt4fUKTsYv8OydXJnvKcA"
"If ordering the beef Wellington, make sure you read the fine print that says it's served rare (or medium rare? I don't remember exactly). If you don't like your meat red, I suggest you order a steak, which can be cooked to order.","2017-03-06","0","OETh78qcgDltvHULowwhJg","v97omifzQ-gsDNc8tBfcfw"

"This is my new favourite children's store. It has fairly reasonable prices for good quality clothes. It has good choices of mix and match in different age groups. For anything I need this is the store I go to. The girls section has super cute and fun clothing. The only thing they can improve on is the shoe section for toddlers, they don't have much choice when it comes to foot wear. Overall, it is a good store and I would recommend it to anyone.","2013-08-06","0","OCigOiQ_gd80wO7xreye7w","P3CiGU1ew64trBH7FMbmhQ"

"It's important to understand the drink pricing. There are actually 3 price tiers. They have ""happy day"" drink specials, meaning those special prices are from 6am-6pm. After 6pm, the prices return to the ""normal"" prices. However, on Friday & Saturday nights, they don't charge a ""cover"" at the door, but drink prices go up at 9pm when the band starts playing. They don't warn you of this in advance, so be advised. It caught me by surprise to see the band surcharge & I didn't appreciate the tactic.","2017-05-27","0","8zN3nV0zbtE377_XhlvabA","164kjF6go0PB2Y06fikHUw"

"I am very confused by the other yelper comments. I've have been t this pizza place a dozen or so times. Perhaps it's because I only go late night (after 12am) and I have never ordered delivery. The cashier has always been very friendly. The portions are obnoxiously big (in a good way) and very inexpensive. The 30 inch pizza is massive, Order 3 times and it has always been topped appropriately. The salads have all been crazy fresh. Open until 3am - awesome for swing shift industry people.","2014-05-25","0","QAXFkN4iDiC1HUrkOiAAKA","ajj3NAUpy7b2T-8yGlPHaA"

All the broth are chicken based. Ask for water and you can add your own seasonings from the sauce station. I managed to ask them to make the Tom yum broth with just water.

"The food here is acceptable - as expected at an airport (though the cheese curds are surprisingly good).  However, the service here is HORRIFIC.  The waitress, after about 10 min swung by and dropped the menu in front of me without a word or a glance.  She then failed to return for another 15-20 min - who knows, it could have even been longer, but my husband and I moved to the bar as we were tired of waiting.

"Why is a hospital serving soup with more than 1200mg of sodium and have food on the menu they don't even have? Beyond gross! Mom and I had to be here for several hours and I hear a nurse tell the patient that since he would be here for awhile she would issue a meal voucher. I ask our nurse and he's like no, we don't do that. I inquire at check in station and the women is like ""I don't do that here"" and offers no other information on where I could possibly inquire.

"After getting ""Food Poisoning"" from this place, I would sincerely recommend to have your food inspected. Get your menus clean at all times. Waitresses need to make you feel welcome and not leave you talking. Also, no need for five (5)TV monitors, it's not a bar. Plus the loud Bachata music doesn't help. A soft instrumental Peruvian music would be much better. Also, don't have the waitresses dry the silverware at the cashier counter.","2015-03-23","0","zt9RLUIU32fZYOBh2L0NNQ","3yb6XvndVvIFPEwkRHUHrg"

Should've gotten a footlong @ Subway and upgraded to a combo for $7.50, at least my sandwich would've been edible and came with a drink and bag of chips, WHAT A JOKE..

The coffee had just a hint of spiciness followed by mocha and hazelnut, while the sandwich lived up to its name!

"My boyfriend and I Have a new favorite spot is Babbo. We stopped in there before closing and were greeted by a very friendly waiter. We ordered the chopped chicken salad and the portabella stuffed mushroom. The food was fresh and tasted amazing. The decor and the restaurant is new open yet cozy. The music was soft but you could still hear each other. I would highly recommend this amazing restaurant. Oh and the prices excellent.

"Horrible, did the design on my toes wrong. Cut up my friends cuticles during her pedicure, then we returned to talk to them about it after we realized there were 5 deep cuts on one foot and three on the other. The manager was more concerned with berating us about coming back then finding out what happened. The nail techs were more focused on making fun of customers then doing their jobs. Received the refund for hers but we will not be back, will go to Dream Nails instead.","2013-08-29","0","edFOP4OKtRTrBtSEtwLNuQ","c4OmXa8Wl4Ab-VUxTJy_2Q"

"The girl who started my pedicure was so rough with the cuticle pusher she cut open the edge of my nail. It wouldn't stop bleeding and I obviously told her not to continue the pedicure. She and the guy who works there kept insisting they could just put polish on my toes, but aside from not wanting to get nail polish into an open cut, I thought it would be pretty unhygienic to get my blood into a polish that would likely be used on many other people. Definitely never coming back!","2013-03-03","0","qKoCB0pmB0wwdDHpw19bjA","P6JVTNhUyBPps-NE5wnWxw"

"Uhm, I had the chicken tacos and really didn't like them. They were soft, grilled tortillas - more like a quesadilla. Way too much cheese, and no sour cream. My rice had bits of dried rice in it-like it had been sitting too long , and feta cheese on my retried beans.  I will not be back. The staff is very friendly. If you go, stay away from the tacos!","2013-06-26","0","mES9E5K4HbYoPFXGv0pUuw","Wp-IrBCNqSc2r3LrPZQjXA"

We had wings as an appetizer after they had let us sample some sauce flavors  and we love gold metal sauce. Delicious! Burgers were cooked to perfection. Robin even bought our dessert. Pot brownie is highly recommended. We will most definitely be back.","2013-07-13","0","3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA","XKBas3xMKC3QV9hU4hrumA"

In trying to schedule an appointment, she asked why I didn't keep up with them and I told her I couldn't afford it. She informed me that she wouldn't do them on me again unless I pay her an additional $30, or I can get my money back from groupon.. guess what I'm gonna do!

They started her pedi&made sure she was close to me&saved a seat next to her for when it was my turn for a pedi. The work was great&they were fast. The only issue was that we didn't get a chance to discuss our services&price beforehand.

"Honestly not quite sure about these other reviews but this was the worst experience I had at a nail salon. My gel manicure took all of 10 minutes, and I don't mean that in a good way. She cut my nails to the nub, didn't bother to file them, did nothing to my cuticles, and slapped the polish in as fast as she could. Other quality gel manicures I have received took time and were of high quality. The paint doesn't even go to the edge of my nail. Never again.","2016-04-15","0","h3ju3Juh42v3JkL4bSXrAg","FyY0XY9qvb-qdcY9KNWvBA"

"The blood may splatter in your eyes at some points during the show, so I would recommend bringing a hankerchief for that. Also, the blood will stain the clothes you're wearing and your skin, but they wash off in the shower and in the washing machine.

In a jam they are really helpful.

Lou is always courteous and helpful , prices are fair and Nick is an excellent mechanic. I noticed they are stocking more clothing and have expanded their parts range.

"Dirty, filthy place.

I worked here for approx 3 weeks and took several photos of how disgusting this place is. I'm not angry, just think the Public deserves to know what kind of restaurant is in their back yard. 

I have other photos. 

If this review helps them get their act together and become responsible business owners, then I have done my service. Food is good. Owners are ignorant as to how a Restaurant should be operated. 

House made desserts are from Safeway. I have pics of that too.","2013-04-17","1","Gi5h_zKjnNLao1MzdyzSAQ","GS1ICn93xbCAH91xPRxPrQ"

The shoe string fries was excellent with add your own seasoning on the side,the western burger was juicy without overly powering spice flavors.

"Forte Family Practice is the worst facility I have been to in Las Vegas. The front staff office treats you like a burden. I have have seen mostly Gifford and Yudez. Yudez made me feel completely insignificant. I was in tears narrowed it down to one question regarding a date which he messed up Anyway and I had to point that out to him! The other problem  I have is that I can hear the staff openly discussing what the next patient will be seen for, how unneeded the appt is.

"My new fav!  The lemongrass chicken is incredible.  So flavorful and - tad spicy!  The service is awesome for newbies like us who have lots of questions.

"the food here is ok, but the service is horrible. we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and gave them a few chances and each time the service is worst then the last. The last straw was when they acted confused and didnt know where to sit us. It shouldnt have been difficult as we had a party of five. Then we sat and sat and sat for at least 15 minutes with no service. Not even to ask for our drinks. I was so frustrated, we just got up and left. Its ok for togo order, but DO NOT DINE IN!!","2013-11-30","0","kPfhSK0kcUmOTmC5DEjaDw","qz36FVc5JU8UXxY_ZNpohw"

"These guys are a disaster and so bad costumer service.

I brought my car there to repaint the bumper. The end result color is totally off!

My car is an off white and they put a white color on top of it. I complained and said I will never bring my car nor refer any clients!

The owner joined his hands as if he's praying and said ""please don't ever come back""

Oh my gosh what kind of costumer service is that?

Unbelievable","2013-09-20","0","yng0ZiHaK9i1qSXzTKscdg","bfrBJywO1NCfSxNDvxDEZQ"

"My really wanted to like this shop. Jenny the manager did my nails.   She was fast and did a great job with the fill.   But then she left for 20 min before I got polish applied.  Another tech was supposed to finish, but she had another client at her table.   When Jenny returned 20 min later she finished my nails but by this time I was so annoyed after having to sit with no explanation. The polish turned out so-so the nail art was terrible.

Although he has no problem trying to short you.","2014-07-11","0","JyCBHRkpw9ca34gEiBIgNA","nlr4JmdZ_8dOWp7TDmMxLQ"

"Fresh Nails has been consistent in clean, professional and friendly services since I  first tried them over a year ago. I get shellac manicures, waxing and pedicures and have been 100% pleased every time. My daughter gets gel nails and loves them. We go about every 3-4 weeks when the nail growth becomes noticeable, even though the actual manicures still look great. Calling ahead is a good idea.

"Awesome 
I dealt with Craig Morris and he was so sincere and honest I was just amazed.
He was beyond helpful and his level of experience was over the top and just a sincere nice person. 
He didn't care if we bought one small item or six appliances at once.
We ended up buying every appliance through him on a new build.
He looked over the plans and made it work.
Just a special person and gave us great prices without trying to up us on anything.
This is the place to go and please look up Craig.","2017-06-10","0","1ZM4ClvDVb7V8fVgTEILZQ","huNfIqma13XWeSUmh5MG0A"

"1. Be firm on your budget. They push you to buy more expensive ones first and it's okay to say no to those! 2. Look at the pearl factory website before you set foot into the booth. These guys are really hounding down for a sale and there are lower budget options such as sterling silver or smaller gold jewelry items. You can also show them which one you want if you like! 3. If you're just curious, I wouldn't recommend it... only go if you're interested in buying.","2017-08-23","0","ztP__QbNm4ZD2E_pWl0YGA","le-4dB1HY_qWm_AO9_k05w"

These wings were AMAZING!  Super good, a lot of meat on the bone and had such awesome flavor and smelt just as good. Sucks they are getting evicted from this spot due to terrible Plumbing by the property owner and won't fix it. But where every they move I'll be back!!

"Disappointing. Wasn't a busy Tuesday evening, had reservations,  seated quickly, received water, menus, and ordered. The waiter brought our glasses of wine then forgot about us until we asked 40 minutes later when our salad would be served.  He brought our pasta order, it was warm,  not hot. Brought out salad after a bit (now on the house). Charged us incorrectly (higher) for the wine.  Disappointed, won't be going back.","2016-12-21","0","5p5YW_5bMOSuLIQjkJPO3w","0sMDR5ct4SIIZZpcmiVvgg"

"I went yesterday again, the lobster sandwich is a joke. It is totally small portion with $15. If you want to enjoy there with messy manner, here is tip.
1.must go lunch time for the fish teriyaki plate with captain boil source seafood in bag. 2. Order lotus roots or corn or side for each $4.95 . Never order the craw fish, or the lobster there. If you order the lobster, you love bragging or you're the first time at here..lol","2017-07-24","0","wKmDYX_XuYCbIerCbYfWnQ","OHJ-b7c8WmBvBQ7_XQ5OAA"

"We went for the lunch buffet, they had a different variety of indian food than I am used to which was great, but the food was mostly disappointing. We liked the naan, and the chicken tikka masala. Most shockingly they had no desserts besides fruit. Also ordered a mango lassi which was not very good, it was too sour and mostly tasted like runny yogurt.","2013-05-05","0","yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug","RcQuN9CwIHaD5Udu7IcmkQ"

I can not even tell you how much more energy I have.  I suggest buying a pack of 6 you save $15 each which is a great savings.

The top rack looked fresh, but he insisted on the darker ones As expected, it was very dry and horrible. Even rice was cold and flavourless, tasted lake they used old frozen veggies (with freezer-burn) in the rice. The feijoada had great flavour but found a 2"" strand of steel wool in it.

If you could speak their language ( Vietnamese ) you could possibly converse with them more.I am fluent in 8 different languages I heard what they were saying.

"My sister in law and me were looking for a nail salon she called to ask what time they closed they said 7... it was 6:45 they were SO nice and asked how far we were that they would wait! Which was the first to say that out of the 5 previous ones we called. We were a little hesitant to go since we thought they would be in a rush for time. When we got there they were so nice and welcoming. They did a great job and we had our girl time. We have now found our new nail salon close to our new home :)","2013-08-25","0","Nn2X-kVJuBjGogWT4CQhSQ","lk8FcuzEgigL3Fatp4Vw-g"

"Bad. Its just bad. I've given this location 3 or 4 tries and I'm disappointed everytime. First the soups were wateted down. Now the soup is so thick its like I'm eating cheese sauce. The fresh broccoli is soggy. How am i to eat that? Everything looks as if it has been sitting since noon and has minimal flavor and low quality. For the same price I coukd have gone to sweet tomatoes and went home happy. I will never return to this location.

"I would definitely eat here again!! The food was delicious! Our server seemed a bit new to the trade, and so was a bit over-conscientious about everything, (topping off our wine glasses frequently to keep them juuuuust under 1\/2 full) but that's a far better problem to have than the alternative. And it wasn't so much a problem as it was cute. The manager (owner?) was friendly, and the whole place had a sort of upscale-yet-welcoming atmosphere.","2013-04-05","0","d00CmCZ6WlNTMlYCfyuZ0g","auFnXYuXJmYXTQHP-jaXfw"

He couldn't even let my 4yr old use the restroom! Sad guy\/place","2013-07-08","0","bu0qCBw2Kqm6nWF4lTC5Kw","8D2dDQHoh-iWi0n6zEALmQ"

So i called (day i reserved van w\/deposit) & told the owner the situation! He agreed to change the dates & car that we originally reserved like 2 hrs prior... Go in change the details of the rental, everything confirmed with the employee, no problem! So i thought it would be easy when day came to pick up the car WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!","2013-07-08","0","bu0qCBw2Kqm6nWF4lTC5Kw","8D2dDQHoh-iWi0n6zEALmQ"

I stopped in this store while my vacation, needless to say it wasn't my plan to buy cosmetics... The sales representative stopped me and encourage me to come in and try, usually I'm suspicios lady and not trying new things while I still have my own cosmetics back home still he was very convincing. I tried it and I like it. First time I'm using products that actually work and make a diffrence .

Oysters tasted ""off"" ... very off which should have told me something. Hind sight is 20\/20 and I am on day three of sickness. Service was the worst.

"I got take-out. The food was not bad. It's not the best, but I can eat it again. I would not go and eat there because the place looks too cramped. What I didn't like was that almost all Indian restaurants let you choose rice or naan bread with your entree but here the dish came with rice and I had to order naan bread separate. This would've still been ok but when I got home there was no rice with my dishes!!! They charged me extra for the naan bread and then skipped on the rice!! Not impressed.","2014-04-13","0","OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A","7sd_-tTMHzgh3MWMGepm6w"

"This is the best Italian restaurant in Mississauga hands down! I have been going here regularly since its opening. I have been to Italy a number of times, and this is the most authentic Italian cuisine you will ever find. The owner Mario is originally from Florence, where he used to run his restaurant business. He is a nice guy. The food is amazing quality. Service is great too! It will make you feel like you are in Italy for a few hours. You must experience Casalinga!

First impression, I was not impressed the way the restaurant looked, I thought it would be one of those kitchens where they just focused on their food. Food service was decent, nothing to complain. I ordered the Beef sandwich and a large poutine. I first started off with the poutine and it was cold. Moving on to the sand-which. There was no taste, 
only thing I tasted was the BBQ sauce, VERY messy. Lastly, they don't have a WASHROOM!","2015-10-03","0","H4-PU2SIOfHgi3R1hCC0-g","YR9u-nP2EmgmV-MbJlKuDQ"

"Brought my car in to get it diagnosed. The speedometer wasn't working. I made an appointment to go into Purcell which they knew nothing of as they seemed surprised when I showed up. I than waited 3 hours for a diagnosis on my car. They wanted to charge me 1100 to fix my control panel. A few days later I took the panel out myself and found that it was simply a loose wire. I fixed it myself in 20
Minutes tops And it was free cause I did it myself. Purcell is horrible!!","2013-04-30","0","DGjkcxp9HaYt61vWgqgYRQ","bvbRnZyzP7oQiD57BgLfwA"

"Stay away from this tour! Waste of money. Rent a car and save yourself the cash. This tour just drove us to Niagara on the Lake and Niagara Falls. It's like a hop on hop off. It's only an hour away from Toronto so you can drive yourself. It was a straight shot drive and no fees anyway so if there are 2-4 of you renting a car will save you money. Driver just talks on the mic and shared boring information. Just google and you'll get more interesting stuff.

I had to let them know we sat to even get service! Wings are below average. All in all service is bad and food has gone down hill I.

The skin is most difficult to make. They have to be not too soft or too hard to cover around the shrimp. Skin should not stick at your teeth either. Of cause the shrimp has to be crispy!

The sauce was pure heat and vinegar. Chicken was placed in a thermal bag and a ladel of sauce was poured over top and the bag closed. The crispy chicken was no longer crispy.

"The customer service was great- the girl at the cash desk greeted me and offered a lemon water while I filled out a quick waiver. Within a 1 minute wait, Zoe, the brow technician escorted me to my seat and worked her magic on my brows! She was very knowledgeable and friendly. She explained what she was doing and was very understanding of my wants and needs. After 20-25 mins, I was done. 
A little pricey but I only ever need to get a brow wax 2-3 times\/year at the most anyway. Highly recommended.","2015-07-21","0","EckRr2CuWs94VWe-24edpA","1Ljt9JI31eAT-vrs49kKIw"

The potatoes and slaw was good however the chicken had very little flavour - other than some hot suave which really tasted like Franks hot sauce. I expected WOW this is good but didn't get that. The big big con in the meal was the chicken was undercooked. In fact the second skewer I started to eat I had to spite out - it was pink RAW CHICKEN! bad!","2015-07-14","0","RL00Hsncq4R-_rJ4pW2Rmw","0r9UlCi_xV8fM569jW7xlA"

As we were walking by some lady comes out of the front door, completely out of her way to yell at us that we ""better not be parked in her spots!"" It was so off-putting im not sure ill ever try it.

"Parking, very limited, and is very small, so for big groups not a great place. 
I waited for over 10 minutes to just receive to pay for a lane. 
Lanes, the room which contains lane 7, DOES NOT HAVE actual number indicators for distance. Only thing that measured distance was the red sprayed lines that cannot be seen at longer distances.
All in all, between parking, the assistance, the lanes, and most important the pricing, I can't say many good things about this place.  Is ill not be coming back.","2016-04-21","0","KW7gFEaN6SyxwsRRz-4IMg","kY4leXelJfTf9tbashFbEw"

"Phosphates often come from dead and decayed organics in your pool. This can be from fertilizer in your own lawn, or it can be blown in from the wind (even invisible amounts). They also come... from an abundance of debris. When you often get leaves, pollen, flowers, bugs, or anything like that in the pool they will sit in your filter and break down into phosphates. Another common cause is dogs, and lots of people swimming in the pool. Keep phosphates away with Stay Fresh Pool Care service!","2013-11-21","0","-V9N7rpVrqm56_QYidCovQ","PUwNp21PSfufmxKk2Jpg-A"

Excellent service and wide selection including desserts, yakitori, steaks, many appetizers, special sushi rolls, fresh sushi pieces. The soft she'll crab appetizer and baby octopus yakitori was my favorite. The sauce they had for my ribeye steak was delicious and went perfectly well with my steak. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

"Good luck trying to book an event because the person they say can coordinate the event has to get permission from her boss who is never around. Nobody else is qualified to book an event either because they know nothing about that side of the business.

Before I had even stepped foot into the gym i'd received 6 phone calls from various so called trainers asking for my acct and routing information to sign up. Dont give it to them, your paying a lot more than it seems and its 100+ to get out of their ridiculous contract. As soon as you walk in they try selling you personal training.

"Avoid it if you are in a big group.

They made us wait for an hour and gave us tables at different corners of the room. The staff appeared to have very little idea of how to manage the seating. Since the food wasn't that great (previous visit), we decided to walk out.","2016-03-22","0","dLc1d1zwd1Teu2QED5TmlA","yEIhMiIc61HwwUxXlB4mbA"

"The ""free"" oil changes they REQUIRE you to purchase when you buy a car are actually $75. On the paperwork it's called a ""maintenance agreement"" and you can cancel it w\/in 30 days & get your money back. If your vehicle has a factory warranty,you need to have it serviced at a dealership that sells the make of your car for repairs to be covered. Do not let anyone tell you different. I know mechanics who hate telling people their claim was refused even if they have receipts from other places.","2016-08-03","0","FehqDxPRMCYE6BHOTCl9eg","xt8JZ2n_aAN06tM_XxafZQ"
