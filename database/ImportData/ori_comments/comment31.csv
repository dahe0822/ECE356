"There's a reason it's called Secret Pizza, it's hidden on the third floor. You just head straight towards the comfy looking lounge and there's a magic door in the wall that looks like you're going somewhere else. After you get your order you can enjoy it eating it at the stand bar or come out to the lounge with your party. The sliced meatballs as topping is perfecto so get that!","2017-05-29","0","iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg","PGdzq1DWMtpXsW51cj0ADg"

Just 5.00 for non-residents and 3.00 for county residents, 4-5 counties?? Beautiful lake views and I got to see a wedding starting at the visitor center. What a beautiful spot for a wedding!

"So extremely disappointed with my dinner tonight. This is my first bad experience here. Whoever prepared my salad messed up badly. It started with my waitress. I ordered my usually buffalo chicken salad. She asked if I wanted that with or without the buffalo sauce. What?  It's a buffalo chicken salad!  I don't know what that glaze on my chicken was but it was NOT the amazing buffalo sauce I usually get. It was like a hint of buffalo with ketchup. The sauce was tacky. So gross.

I asked for the avocado & grapefruit salad, since it was the only fresh item on the menu. I asked if they could make it heavy on the avocado. I was told, ""No, that means we would need to open a new avocado, and we're trying not to make any mistakes in the kitchen today"". Really?

"Definitely a good place but I still prefer barbarian over this one. Appetizers are huge so don't order a lot if you want to enjoy your steak. Steaks were good but nothing exceptional that you would die for. We had porterhouse and bone in rib. The former was served even almost cold. Sides are all good and huge. You can order sides as half portion to try more options. Staff are friendly and nice. I recommend barbarian before trying this steakhouse and you'll see the difference yourself.","2014-08-09","0","4POPYEONJpkfhWOMx_PyGg","JoMxHFRCJL8CS-VJ4Qjo8w"

Parking can be a pain, but it's 100% worth the effort.","2013-08-13","0","y0TTPR0K5iB4oMkgVUH1ig","autNAJmn50rrMiq4qTbGhg"

The cheap wine (whole bottle in store is less than their glass but I get it) feels good. The shrimp lo mein is reliable but I hear the orange and general tso are both very good.

Adam the manger came by to see how we were doing and since it was our first time offered us dessert on the house.  You could see him out talking with the customers making sure everyone was happy.  I was totally impressed with everything.  A new favorite for Surprise!   Well done Adam and staff!!","2015-05-08","0","vg4KopGHV778wmsKErAMQw","1FPU1GgPrd9cQJYJkkcUnQ"

Interesting little cafe love the down to earth vibe and possibly the best music ever! The herb salmon creme cheese was very flavourful, punch you in the face flavour. I probably should have ordered it on a different bagel. The sesame bagel was sweet and subtle. I would avoid getting the espresso, very flat and not at all tasty.

It was $34 total including the $5 parking and they didn't even have all the attractions open tonight which happened to be opening night!! Seriously?

There was no pain! they gave me antibiotic ointment, anti-itch cream, and an ice pack before i left; all free!! (the icepack helps relieve the after feeling.)

The long wait and crowded front counter typically signals future-famous quality Italian food, but instead we received untrimmed chicken chunks, canned mushrooms, and stuck together ziti as their Chicken Marsala.

"When I went today, I just needed a new hoop put into my preexisting nose piercing. When he tried to put in the hoop, he didn't bother to sanitize my nose first. Then realizing the hoop didn't fit, he decided to stretch the hole, also without sanitizing the two needles he put through my nose. Needless to say, the piercing is completely swollen and infected now. I realize that I should have said something but I personally figured there would have been standards they followed.

"To help ease digestion of meals, did you know it is actually best to avoid consuming fluids while eating? Drinking fluid during a meal will dilute your stomach acid and disrupt\/delay digestion, making you feel fuller faster and even give you that ""bloat"" feel. Instead, try this simple tip: drink a glass of water upon waking up, 30-minutes prior to each meal, and 30-minutes prior to bedtime (will aid in sleep, burning calories, cleansing the body of toxins and can even help prevent strokes)!","2014-12-15","0","Nu2CMMUeGH6sSzlmwnFY1Q","1ZLlPgooNbdQtCpDeo3SgA"

"Very disappointed with the fish tacos which are supposed to be the flagship. They are made with 17 ingredients and the fish is lost in mango, cabbage and mayonnaise. No joke I would much rather rubios for a fish taco.  Also Blue32 sports bar up the street has much better fish tacos. Friend had the Ono fish sandwich which is a much better choice.

The chips that came with the guacamole were store bought. Total bill was 50. What a rip off.","2013-01-05","0","n-y6kw55Tn-5Get2TkWgeA","_VD_dUVGBGagQxSehio2gw"

"The fried fish taco is their baby jesus. It is hands down the best fish taco your little taste buds will ever encounter. First off start with the flour tortilla then add the battered covered fish that is fried to perfection add cabbage, cheese, peco then drizzle the secret sauce. Then squeeze some lime, add green and red salsa and eat until you explode. Guaranteed best fried fish taco. My mouth waters at the very thought of holding this glorious masterpiece in my hands.

"Pros: music is cool, scenery and art direction is cool. There were 10 minutes of real good acts.

Cons: cost 90 dollars, 30 minutes of dick and boob jokes, 20 solid minutes of repetitive dissapearing acts dissapearing from the same place in the stage again and again, 20 minutes of self-promotion, and half of the audience participants were shameless plants.

It always feels a little weird picking spots in Vegas, just because, well, Vegas. But Bachi is one of the most unique burger spots in the country. The burgers all have vague Asian influences, and are all so damn delicious in very different ways, but if I had to choose one I would opt for Kiki's, because it involves this sweet onion marmalade, Gruyere, and a garlic-chili aioli I have tried to replicate at home. Oh, and the caramelized bacon helps too.","2015-08-09","0","7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA","W8Rf7y6vPn4c5WJvSGbRng"

"I been going to this market for a few years now . I believe that food is medicine. they  have prices that are extremely reasonable on their large inventory of spices and the vegetables are very fresh . I can always fine spices that I can find no where else I can always count on them to either have them in stock ,or  they are more than happy to order for you. They also have a small restaurant and it is a family owned business so it all comes together to make a sweet harmony.","2014-09-03","0","saQQmDQQJ14BVkm_sg53UA","SOLEJ8fs0QtkoW5IOJ1Deg"

Our bill was $110 for a flight of reds, sparkling water, a beer, soup (tonight, a modern beef barley), smoked salmon tostada app, our entrees, 3 ports and fried dough.  Brought a good portion home because we couldn't resist the offerings and wanted the experience to last!","2014-05-16","0","50UjA4nDdqypN-hBUOAPmQ","wJBG0Crl4rDb44c9wRYO8w"

I guess my standard has changed since I started watching the food Chanel , the service was good but the food was not good , ordered a Caesar salad that was served without dreasing , huge chunks of lettuce, it looked like they were rushed to push this out of kitchen, then a tuna roll that looked more like a pie and supper salty and spicy.

I am disappointed in the menu that I was served. It had more bones than meat. I also had breakfast tacos chorizo and eggs and ham and eggs on corn tortillas with all the fixings. They did not disappoint but the menudo was not what I expected. I'm hoping this is just a one time thing.","2017-10-29","0","S3-JpB5dBhMXmauMqeoN-g","RI7I2TRYFjnHShWxno3uyg"

"Excellent new York style pizza.  That's a compliment...as well as a warning to ""Ohio style"" pizza lovers.  What is ""Ohio Style"" pizza?  Well, it's not NY thin and not Chicago deep...it's somewhere in between, just like Ohio.  So if you like angelo's or Danny boys, you might not like deweys.  I do recommend getting their pizzas well done to ensure a crispier crust.  Staff is great, quality control is great, love the place.

"Heard so much about this taco shop place. Lacks tremendous customer service and the food was just blah! Horcharta drink was very good, one of the best I've tried in a while. I would not return to this place. I got the 2 for $20 deal: 2 pastor tacos and 2 carne asada burritos; carne asada was not good at all; pastor was good. Salsa for chips: was asked to pick wither medium or hot and i ordered hot; wouldnt want to know what the medium was like?? ketchup based?

"First time in today. Friendly staff. Decor needs some work. It is a cross between a living room & diner. Too many televisions for my taste. Televisions in a cafe just doesn't seem right. 

The latte I had was good but not special. I ordered a Danish and it ended up being pre-packaged not fresh. They only charged $1.99 for it so it's not too bad but I'd rather a place claiming to be a cafe have fresher food.","2016-06-17","0","_R76PYZqTRvw840SP6s5GA","zvIM7M-nFcsockXoc823RQ"

I was charged only one hour labor and the cost of the needed parts with no mark up. AC service is $29 plus the cost of Freon (about $59) and an oil change for $14.95. They are a breath of fresh air from the high labor rates with.inflated hours plus high mark ups on parts at the dealers.

"Do NOT eat here. Hot bar lunch went from $6.99\/lb to $7.99\/lb, quality went WAY down. Today's ""roast"" chicken tastes like they cooked it in the same oil as fish. They put cherry tomatoes in ALL beans & veggies (weird and not good). ""Stewed"" carrots still raw. Cauliflower and broccoli are mushy. All veggies very bland!

It's a superb venue looking out over Newhaven Harbour, but should have more blinds to block the evening sun! (I needed sunglasses to see my friends!).

On the other hand, the waiters were fantastic.","2012-08-22","0","se9MhDAQjACYMO3LCIfT1Q","ANo3nebc-pBvPZOnyc1uoA"

Service was really friendly too.

I went into the new back yard where they have lots of plants, most which are perennials, which is fantastic as you tend to get your monies worth!   Really good range of plants and some of which I've not seen before too. Do go& have a peak, even if you haven't got a garden.

Bacon roll was good. Nice roll, tasty bacon too.

"The Fish and Chips and the Hunters Chicken are delicious!                                 The folowing tip is for tourists: If you want to go there and have dinner with somebody who is not 18 years old yet, make sure to be there at around 6 pm or earlier, because people under 18 are not allowed in pubs after 8 o'clock. That way you can still calmly enjoy your meal without any stress.","2016-10-27","0","B2T8prf2h9OFoq843t8tcQ","jxEpEWZu1m4rTNm1VVG3JQ"

"The food is dreadful here at least for what I was expecting at an American branded hotel.  The rooms are in desperate need of a makeover.  To believe that this hotel is up to Hilton standards is incredible.  80s paneling and tiling. The bathroom vanity literally is falling apart. Lumpy bed.   No rollaway options and only twin size beds available.   they should knock this dump of a hotel down and require it to have Hilton standards. In the alternative remove the Hilton name.","2015-08-16","0","ORFJ8onuUtj7s5c3nWNwwQ","ny5BfZ3MDmZr8HlRt1Jf5w"

Not totally horrible, but not professional.   Then I saw one of the bartenders, a chick with painted on eye brows, drag a garbage can through the place, bumping into several people eating.

"Horrible service. Our order wasn't even right. With the order not being right and horrible service, we didn't dare to ask for the ""right"" order. Never going back.

If it gets busy in the restaurant; they will not take in walkins an only resos; best time to reserve a tables are as such 1-3 for breakfest and 7:30-closing best days to reserve are monday-wednesday or sunday night. Their food quality doesn't degrade if its busy or slow as the chefs in house have expectations and will not serve food unless it's above expectation.

1) make a reservation & have your entire party there before expecting a seat.

2) get into the menu once everyone has been seated. Talk and catch up while you wait for the food.

3) let us all enjoy this amazing, delicious dosa. When you're party is done with your meal (try the filter coffee) leave and let the next person come sit, so they too can  appreciate the food.  

4) if you want a more relaxed experience don't come here on Fridays or the weekend.","2016-03-26","1","LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA","cdpO0F0kGP07FVCRp8RBXw"

"Am at dstairs bar right now. Usual eat here a few times\/m order'g fish or scallops. $$$ but good. But 2nite I just ordered calamar app after btdr said ""it's great"". Got fresh order after got the nite's dried up leftovers.  Off-shift employs drop'g f-bombs (next 2 me) & complain'g of a..hole customers who make last reservs of night--the off-duty hostess joked how she only offers outdoor seat at that hour to turn people away. Not a cheap place, but getting lazy in custserv & food. Won't be back.","2013-09-24","0","DzVv_g6xsLbMh66HtiZK3A","M2RHC0ivIcB7-dxVsO7PFA"

"I've been visiting Ken for awhile now however once he left Fringe I decided to book an appointment with Colin, I must say he was a pleasant surprise, they didn't have the colour I asked for but he was nice enough to offer to place an order for it. Great attitude, very friendly and most importantly he did a great job on my lifeless thick fizzy hair. I left feeling great about my hair and will definitely be going back to visit him soon.","2013-09-21","0","nVo5Zq_9N9eQR-FUrrQ51g","Kyc3Q77IVI4VQ27Tt-_hpA"

He was extremely helpful and sympathetic throughout the re-design process collecting feedback from me at every stage of the process.

"I usually like this Ulta. But I went in with my husband to find him a new cologne and the security guard watched us like a hawk the entire time we were smelling them, making us EXTREMELY uncomfortable. He profiled us by our races which is pathetic, being 2014. To top it off, while my hubby was in line to pay, I cruised the NYX section and the guard came over to watch me some more. In a store FULL of people, he chose to watch us, the least likely to steal. Very disappointing.","2014-03-09","1","9uj0o9kwe6FQNspkc5N6HA","iVkrqjcLLp-sCl9fKy4-pg"

I've never experienced something like that, and the girl at the check out counter acted so annoyed toward me.

"Traveling in to Vegas , I found my hotel continental breakfast wanting.... Travelled to Eggworks, about 10 minutes from the hotel, and was amazed! It's exactly what a breakfast place should be - good portions, good prices, friendly service, and even free wifi. We had Candice as our server and even though she was a trainee she handled out order like a pro. I highly recommend Eggworks for your breakfast needs whilst in Vegas. (I had the Mexican omelette and could not even finish the huge portion)","2014-03-06","0","PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw","i8mW8FoSucMFmoh3fLd3Rg"

Outside of the great atmosphere, fantastic cocktails, and cultured following, the wait staff are super helpful in helping new people figure out the best drink on the menu for them.

"I have been getting my hair cut and styled for over a year by Eva. She has always been warm, professional and courteous while artfully cutting my difficult hair and blowing it into a manageable style. 

And yes, the decor is very dated , but clean and the lack of stylish decor is factored into the prices.  A wash and style is a mere $20.  I haven't seen a price like that in a decade.

Finally a table did become avaiable and we asked if we could have it. We were seated and continued to be ignored. We left.

"My husband took my car in Thursday. I am a monthly paid customer and attendant couldn't find the car listed on the monthly plan. I told my husband to make sure the Windows and gear shift console was cleaned. When I inspected my car when he returned home. NONE OF IT WAS DONE. I called, spoke to Tim and he said that he will call me back after inspecting the video. I'm still waiting. I called Saturday and left a voicemail. STILL WAITING. Cancellation is coming. I will go to Auto Bell and pay them.","2016-05-15","0","1vcE4KjJITF-VTFNiqE0vQ","uSUVeiWC2-IYaw4aW168OA"

Beds were made beautifully and make you fill as you were sleeping in a hot apple pie. Bathroom clean and filled with fluffy towels and robes. And little touches such as USB charging in every place you can imagine. We spent the day at the pool and the kids were overwhelmed with all the activities! Be back soon!","2017-09-30","0","HkY2wwA_cvTyxSllbsZDBA","IO2UoN1knwIEnJTwYyOuHQ"

If I would suggest just a couple things. The bread is supposedly homemade, im not a fan. I would prefer a crusty piece of real italian bread. These are more like soft rolls. Also, the meatballs are very mushy and soft.","2013-12-31","0","gZYt10Kn-eHpo3n4lx3iBg","-ujy-zm2EsD7w_xgrgFCJw"

Men& women practice next to one another with concern & humor while consciously caring for their body's flexibility & strength. Whether you're new to the practice or a seasoned yogi, I recommend this\/my yoga studio for a great community of physically aware& welcoming people!

"I am visiting charlotte for work and found this place from yelp since it has a lot more comments than the other Vietnamese places. This place's interior is nicely done, clean and bright.  The price is consider high for pho and the portion is not that big.  The taste is fine, but not a lot of meat inside.  I have seen more non-Asians in this place than Asians when i was eating, that usually tells you it is probably not a very authentic pho place.  
It is not a bad place, but I won't be back.","2013-07-27","0","s6lTNO57vXsfzyYrPfXOvA","WvODjSvHkOPadwKfncnVCA"

"After searching between 4 different dent repair shops I finally chose ding doctor and I'm glad I did. He rescheduled a prior appointment so that he could fit my busy schedule and got the 3 dents fixed in, what others told me would take two hours, he fixed in 30 minutes for an extremely reasonable price. I recommend to anyone! And it's mobile! Great work.","2013-03-07","0","eHeIEqbGF8xvbZwjPm1zng","kstJs3lB6y19GNEQVi2alQ"

"Nothing to write home about but it's certainly decent thai food.  Pad thai good albeit unimaginative. Pad woon sen slightly better dish.   Green curry very fresh.  brown rice good.  Good lunch special, inexpensive.  Nice servers and fast service.  Could be cleaner paticularly near the bathroom.","2013-02-11","0","7FLHJMOYszFPCqK3tg5umA","IIkeA0Tv_pOa0E6FcljbDg"

"l use to love this restaurant. Sadly, as usually happens it has changed. The Pad Thai l got had such a strange flavor l couldn't eat it. I am a huge Thai food lover and eat it often so l know what is supposed to taste like.  My Yum Woon Sen was bad too. Strange flavors, not right. The shrimp was undercooked.  I will be marking this one off.  Too bad, it use to be very good and fresh.","2013-04-03","0","7FLHJMOYszFPCqK3tg5umA","hlZr3cVCDRzTuypjWqD9_A"

"We ordered three rolls: 90%, Geisha, and Vampire. We found each to be quite tasty, but enjoyed the spice of the 90% and the Vampire the best. They have a nice flair to the rolls that is quite different from what you find at other restaurants. Server was knowledgeable and made great suggestions. Staff was very friendly. Manager came to check on guests and was very nice as well; even mentioning special deals. We will visit again in the future!","2013-08-02","0","KhvuMJpYNNySVxsu2o1eqg","RFwh_YX-UtHsEf7yZkcuKQ"

"Turf has\/had Smithwicks, an Irish red ale, and my favorite beer, last time I was there in Dec of 2010. Both it and its sister public house, Seamus, have a good ambiance and staff. I'm still looking for lamb dishes-- have to go to Ireland for split grilled lamb kidneys with bacon and potatoes for breakfast I suppose.

Valet is a huge issue! & they don't have self parking. We came during one of the busiest times of the year, so you would think they were better prepared. Instead, they had minimal amount of workers, they checked out our car without authorization, then lost it; took them 2 hours to find it! If you have a flight to catch or any plans, make sure you have enough time in case it's packed, or they check out your car without authorization and then lose it.","2016-06-20","0","WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q","L3xMvAU8z6UCHpi3YtIwMw"

Only downside to me, is that I have not seen many rolls in their menu that includes crab meat.

I tried the tapioca noodles combo #25 with the wontons and sea food fake crab and shrimp. At under $7.00 how can you go wrong?","2016-06-09","0","XDoS2eETLrG53caNkchd3g","8jA82ArN-7NZ4Z7JaTS_wQ"

"Wanted to give this place a try with my wife on Friday night. We were seated by hostess and sat for 15 minutes without sight of a server. Asked another passing server if they knew where our server might be. She said that she was in the back of the restaurant and would ask her to come by. Another 10 minutes passed. Nothing. Left and went to monte cellos where we got prompt friendly service. Sorry Stokes. We tried to give you our money. Won't happen again.","2015-11-13","0","LkcGDfznt-QzjL22fO3F4Q","qzZgaZKtpXKMlK7MFRwzUQ"

"Great East Coast Pizza not NY ""STYLE"" But true NY Pizza taste & texture. A true hidden gem for all of Las Vegas glad I live  on this side of town. Subs & Cannolis are also good stuff. Wings were surprisingly really good as well. Haven't tried any pasta plates but I rarely order pasta dishes from the pizza joint even when I lived back east. Final verdict Great Pizza Place if you live or happen to be in SW part of the valley skip the franchise joints & go with Familia Pizzeria","2016-04-20","0","oH6QAuoTLFaX97oqqpLTMg","Cn3hPBTBmghyeYMLoBQgAA"

"This place is always quiet, especially in comparison to the nearby bbt places in the area such as chatime and real fruit, so this place is perfect for a quick grab and go (I personally love their wintermelon creama). However, because of the infrequency of customer visits, sometimes their bubbles aren't as fresh as I'd like them to be.  I'd normally get other toppings that won't change in texture the longer they've been sitting out, such as the herb jelly (which is pretty darn delicious).","2016-06-10","0","jEABBfAVPPY0BcVxlRatGg","yViMmyZcyCtBa8D7uGryaQ"

I have now called 2 times and was told the driver was dispatched 18 minutes after letting them know of the mixup in the order.  Im so pissed and hungry.   I will never order from here again.  Food is good, but every single time without fail they mess up the order. It's high college kids taking your order.  This is not how you run a business.  When I complained I was yelled at for being frustrated","2016-10-01","0","WWqdy9PKOSyhLgHIGaNFrA","uXyGIZNh8IcGi66oMeA2cg"

"We took our 4 yr old boxer to see the vet in township in nc. He has a growth on his eyelid. It popped up suddenly and has grown and a tremendous rate. They looked him over and gave us a estimate for $2500. To have the mass removed and reconstruct his eyelid. Plus they freaked us out saying it was cancer. Of course thus us way out if our budget. We then went to another vet and they looked at it took some cells and looked under the microscope and no cancer just a hystiocytoma.

"Went here in March (2 for $99 service). Went to Brittany-referred by recept for blond. Terrible! My hair was bright  orange on top & she charged me $150 instead of $99! She said cuz she added a few low lights it was $50 extra! Shady! She hardly put any low lights in & my hair was orange! She wanted to charge more money to fix the color! I was so angry I left & will never go back! There are way better salons with HONEST & GREAT COLOR SPECIALISTS!

The colour\/highlights is amazing and it is exactly what I had in my mind. Stephan is so friendly and funny, I enjoyed talking to him while he was working on my hair. Their price is a bit expensive for me ($280 for cut and highlight and colour) but it totally worth it as I will need only to dye my roots for next 5 months!","2015-09-15","0","Cyy95sS5r6MGzgEA4UZX5g","4J-diDyvILjbmwU0b8s12A"

"My tip is this.....if you are a woman, think twice before patronizing this bar, the security staff is not helpful and will not have any problems being physical,  even with women.  Just read other posts.   I posted a comment on this bar on yelp and the manager is now texting me threats to sue me because i expressed my experience,  on a public forum, created to do just what i did.  I think a tip would be to care more about how your patrons feel after a bad experience and treat them better.","2016-03-29","2","4V2KN03EJMzaoOmLOy5UhQ","Q2i96pLG_oPq75LXidqtyg"

The only thing I wish I would have seen was the guy making pizza use gloves as he was putting topping on a pizza he was picking stuff off his fingers and adding it to the pizza. Please wear gloves and stop picking toppings off your fingers.

"A hidden gem in the heart of Phoenix. I pass The Parlor almost daily and never realized it was there. Glad we found it. Great city-urban atmosphere. Pizza was good (3 outta 5) but the environment saved it. Fab bar and drinks. Take friends and relax. Fun, nice city eating.","2012-07-12","0","k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ","zhQ8XCCvvhLAIRaNIcth0g"

"Do. Not. Forget. Your. Stamp. Card! They will not stamp you if you do, even if you're a regular like me. Which is a real bummer b\/c other places, like Matador, have never said no to me (since I was also a regular there). Nonetheless I think it'd be great if they started asking their patrons if they have one. I've been coming here for several years and the stamp card is fairly a new thing, so it's easy to forget sometimes! :(","2014-09-26","0","qQCsLGMncJp1xWUGnOKCQA","-o0I7l3fdoRULj7kn8KMLw"

"I used to love this place. But when a place cannot keep to their listed hours and turns  my party away, they quickly lose my adoration. So I guess I will be taking my business across the street. Their food may not be as good, they don't have the same ambience, and they're not open late, but they do stay open until their listed time.","2014-04-09","0","5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg","YNtH9vbkgMxFcDaeMh8rew"

"Trying a new sushi spot. I ordered 4 rolls: California, Las Vegas, shrimp and crunch. It was okay. I liked that they give you a free salad and soup to start. The soup was ok but I did really like the salad dressing! My husband had the teriyaki chicken and didn't like that the cooked veggies were mixed with a salad. He said the rest was okay. I thought the shrimp roll and California roll were good but we prefer the crunch roll and las vegas rolls elsewhere much better.

"I just try there wings and they are good. The cobbler, omg, is great. I try it just out of the oven. All it needs is some ice cream on top. I work at the strip and I know about high end food. This kind of places care about the quality since they cook everything to order. Not pre-cooked like BWW.","2012-12-28","0","Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg","akLIKSw5zGxxWtWkNCYrJg"
