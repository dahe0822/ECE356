"POOLS:  The pools were nice, but they close in the late afternoon\/evening.  You should consider a cabana which runs $250-$1000 per day.  Or only use the pool in the morning until 11am and again from 3:30pm to 5pm.  There is smoking at the pool, but you can take a dip, exchange the towels, and move locations away from the cigar smokers around you.  Ninja skills preferred, but not required.  The food is also good at the pool.  Spent almost all day, every day out there.","2016-06-08","0","VyjyHoBg3KC5BSFRlD0ZPQ","Jz6UAgmiVjOCV2pRVUtoww"

"Your Local Game Store is by far the best game store in Charlotte. They have a really spacious play area and a remarkable selection of games for purchase. They offer a great membership that allows players to check out games from an extensive game library. You can play as many games in the store for a full month, then apply the membership dues toward any purchases you make that month. Timothy and Rebecca, the store owners, are some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet. Come check it out!","2013-03-02","0","CFeodUIPB3sQYSEXX_XpzQ","o9wxhSxN6HPSxOM_voae3w"

All I can say is that there is a difference between crossfit gyms and it lies in the programming, competitors to measure against, and the community.  I've found all three and I'm glad to call Urban Warfit my family.  Come train with the best.","2014-02-09","0","H_ywbto9ElAaJMo-S92Mbw","apOYo_OapNbSwmHrmFT7LA"

Tonight, I was driving my daughter home on the 101 S near Shea. An officer in an SUV swerved into the HOV lane behind me, started flashing his brights at me, and when I moved into the next right lane, he flew by me flashing his blue and red lights and honking his horn.

Crust was perfect thin crusty-chewy with light flavorful tomato sauce, lots of cheese and great crumbled sausage. Cavatini With hearty meat rage was also very good with fresh pasta. Service was very good and attentive. Had concert tix and they were able to get us in and out in under an hour.","2016-04-29","0","By7P2EBBvhqoSDj8PnQa8g","J2PX0ubuImg0YL10IHuW5Q"

"Decent Thai\/Laotian food that is not too far into State Street. The service was great and the food came in pretty quickly. I ate inside, but I heard that dining in their outdoor space is a fun experience. The inside has tacky decorations. I ordered the Panang curry with tofu, which could have been a bit more flavorful. Crab rangoons are great. Make sure to have cash or check- they don't accept cards!","2013-08-01","0","7Tp53xZh1ypd2wbudP6Qcw","VWECnpBZkQtBJThq0Bmyew"
"Get the appetizer platter.  For 6.95 you get spring roll, eggroll,  satay, crab ragoon and beef Jerky. Eggrolls are my favorite.   Also bring cash.  Sign says cards are not accepted.   But there are ATMs in the area.","2014-05-31","0","7Tp53xZh1ypd2wbudP6Qcw","-3E9y4e9ndR8v_DSNTVaNQ"

The older one is nice but messes up pretty often, shes not fluent in English so sometimes communication is hard. I brought my brother in again last week and wasn't happy with how she left his eyebrows after I clearly explained multiple times how I wanted them done and also asked Kris to translate :\/","2016-09-28","0","H_FwiRpgRcXSV-v1-N4Qhw","CjSjNjsuhrbmIbKtk8xOWw"

"My friend and I had the Penne with Vodka Sauce. I have never been able to find a vodka sauce that is better than the one I make at home. It was rich and creamy and had a deep flavor like it had been simmering all day on the stove. It was so incredibly satisfying that I almost licked my bowl clean. The loaf of bread that was brought to our table was definitely homemade and was soft, and warm. Prices were great and our entrees came with a salad and the bread. Delicious!

Although the new Suhi bar prices are fairly high for a roll ($10 rainbow roll), they are pretty friggin delish given that it's a pick up, pay, and grub type of sushi.

It's not even the first time either. Also, when we call to order take out they would either say they are closing early or they would say their kitchen broke down. Terrible.","2017-02-23","0","yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw","kK-NklR8rOBsdBXL4oJLZg"

They also cut me so badly during the manicure that I bled all over the place. I think they cut a vein bc it would not stop bleeding.

"A general rule of thumb before ordering furniture online - read all shipping and return policies before you make your purchase!

Everyone was pushing and shoving & it took me 3 tries to get into the bathroom. The line was ridiculously long & on top of that you would have to wait once you got inside too.

"Pretty good. No clue how it compares to Phoenix Ethiopian restaurants. It's pretty good compared to the D.C. ones. Butter at some dc places are more fragrant than what's found here. But still good. 

Three people asked me at least a total of five times whether I liked the food (I had gored gored, kitfo, and tibs). Think it was a combination of the rarity of an Asian in Phoenix compounded with the rarity of an Asian eating Ethiopian food, and that they wanted me to like their food...","2014-06-22","0","JnotDMU1KOYHm5kHHuPnyg","JtSKL-SbFQ_C9FbFNRygSQ"

"Just picked our 8 month old pup after 9 days ... She looked great and was all clean for us. Reception was friendly coming in and going out and we are very pleased with the service we received. It was no problem to plan around the hours they are open and we have two young kids. If you use the services right you end up saving time and money because of the features of the packages. We upgraded on her last night and paid less for daycare and grooming than we would have. Great job!","2013-07-06","0","KVOdk6TqB1RO-uCzBxIqIg","5JljoAdtCO1ZzqRCYbByDA"

"I went to the angry crab last night and decided to dine at the bar with a couple friends. It was our first time and we had no idea what to order or what we would like, I just have to say they have the best bartender who was so incredibly helpful! Chris helped us get our order in, which took us probably 10 minutes to understand the sauces&spices, btw the drinks he made us were amazing! Great service, great food and great drinks. Thanks Chris, I hope you work next friday :) I highly recommend!","2015-11-21","0","ZKsVCA89iXMccf3fEhS3iw","K0lcWq2HUtk9kT6WqN1NTQ"

"In the deli they have restrictions to what you can have in your personal meals, even though if you bought it separately at 1\/ 8th of a pound,  equates to a serving size, and is cheaper.  Sometimes you just don't want coleslaw as a side for your meal. Sometimes, you just want crab salad, or potato salad. If you are going to have a meal, and like variety, don't get the meal, order the food individually because it's the only way they can think past the cost for some reason.","2016-09-14","0","MjGvGVvYV5WBVU2eGF1F7A","nYSoK4ck0e39KxGWWoalGQ"

"Really not a good place to buy anything you ever expect to have a glimmer of a hope returning if its not 100% perfect. Forget about buying ammo here. Almost double the price of any other retailer in town. Attitude from every guy behind the counter. And good luck getting them to respond to email, much less answer the phone. Response at counter when you advise them of an issue ""We get really busy"". Not just to me, I hear them say that to customers on multiple trips in. Bottom line... No bueno.","2013-06-12","0","ZIGLsDPyC-46eBhNxToVYA","3gcolvNSKmASF4B0998JNQ"

Ammo was more expensive than it should be at a range, but I think the facilities provide you with an overall better experience and that costs money. Want a cheaper range... Shoot outdoors.  I find it ironic that some reviewers tout Scottsdale GC as a better value. That's a joke in my humble opinion.

"If your baby needs a frenectomy make sure to book Baby a chiropractic adjustment on the SAME DAY. Surgery changes the anatomy of the mouth and baby will need to relearn how use its tongue to nurse. 
Dr. Rebecca Kleckner at Kids Rising Pediatric Chiropractic is absolutely the best. (602) 832-6389
 
Also, infant Tylenol given 1.5 hours before and after the surgery and ANOTHER DOSE given given 2 hours BEFORE the Chiropractic adjustment will help baby tremendously.","2016-07-12","0","h3isloSGHXApptQDiFLA_A","GHhMx6N0UwCss5EuEP_54w"

The cost of everything had gone way up, and nothing tasted like it use to.  Even the normal house salad tasted like it had fish in it.

"Alise is right, I had my root canals redone on the left side and they all ended up falling out. Dr. Richins insisted I needed it which turned BS and notice how his office is always empty?

She never apologized and just kept going. I ended up with an infection on my heel even though I came home and immediately applied Neosporan for several days.

"Out of a party of 17, 2 didnt get their meals. We told the manager and he finally brought them out when we were ready to go so we gave them back unbeaten. We told him not to charge us and we left back on the ride.  He called the police and locked us in the stable til they got there. We told the police what happened and he let us go. That manager needs to learn how to deal with the public. Our party spent over $500 and he had the nerve to call the police over a $30 dinner that she never received.","2014-02-16","0","2bXyG9i01EjS9ttdnXToDw","eW6lfdZpTIjX10ivNDuuFw"

I have had gyro sandwich a lot & never seen it that greasy! Plus all gryo sandwichs I have tried the white sauce goes on top of the sandwich.at chicago gyro he puts the sauce on the bottom & meat on top as a result all the sauce is melted","2014-09-20","0","2PkCvqcVZUmPndaqsyWqdw","bt973YzIK4MBt3ugucPB-w"

When she called to tell me the price I asked if she could do any better than that and she said no so I drove all the way to the shop to pick up my dress... When I got there then she wanted to negotiate and offered to do it for $90. I got my dress altered for $85 at seams to be alterations instead..

"Take your business elsewhere. After getting nowhere with the Manager , Gina, regarding a free upgrade that I had earned I end up cancelling my membership as well as my wife's membership. Horrible customer service. I've been a longtime member through now the 3rd owner of this establishment and they just lost our business because of the Manager's refusal to honor a free upgrade that may cost about 7 dollars. Not a smart business move. With Managers like Gina you may not be in business much longer.","2014-06-01","0","5p-ait6fq3oHOmJma8jJzg","SAcvN5mANJTQKITazXfTPg"

Don't order lamb beef souvlaki, it's nothing more than a meatloaf mixture that is very salty and generic tasting.

"3 months in its a beautiful place to live. Awesome pool with a fire pit and cabanas. Nice people for the most part. Maria and Rachel are great. Mario and Alvarado are on top of any maintenance concerns. It's off the 101, so it's easy to get around. Apartment doesn't exactly have the upgrades you'd expect. Basic low end appliances, small sink without a sprayer. Black linoleum that rubs off on your feet. Small but comfortable porch. Very loud pool parties.

The owner if I'm correct her name was Gilla was extremely rude she was short n very unfriendly i don't understand how someone could run a business and care nothing about customer service.

"Ok my only complain about this place is that they haven't updated their check out format, they still use the old school cash register and this is a problem when it gets busy during the weekend. I wanted to get my check split and as you can guess it was a nightmare the hosted had to ring up everything separately!

"What cleaner do you use to mop your tile floors??
Most floor cleaners you buy at the store are petroleum based which means there is oil in them. This means you are leaving a film of oil on you tile and in your grout lines then you walk on them and that oil attracts dirt. For porcelain Or ceramic tile you can use white vinegar @ 1\/4 cup to two gallons of hot water vinegar is a natural acid that will help cut through the dirt but will not leave a film .","2016-03-15","0","flvHqBtyXSB-FP3eNJdkGg","cIK4hs-DatwVCb2yf4sOBQ"

I was really confused with the online reservation I had made for the Spazmatics and thought I had reserved a table but no! You were so helpful and courteous and made sure we had a table even though it was slammed. I hope someone sees this and promotes you!

Staff are friendly enough, although definitely all feel very fresh on the job. Prices seem a bit high, although some of the perks (24 hr drop off, etc) seem pretty appealing.

Their dinners have always been very tasty with large portion & we've never lacked for service. A shame...they had a good Saturday prime rib special and some other menu items we loved. Their breakfast is comparable to nearby competitors so we won't bother returning for that. Gonna miss their dinners.","2015-08-13","0","cghHesD2NXV5yUu-ZAxE2g","awc9UwCGo3LMwcPaS121-A"

"Ron is the go to person about chemicals for your pool. The knowledge he taught to us about chemicals took away from the frustration with the scheduling problems. He's the best!!   UPDATE: After having our pool the first year the finish became dark and discolored.  Adams claim is ""The water is hard ""  they sold us the upgrade material told us what chemicals to use. Refuse to back the material.  Spent over  $6,000 on a once beautiful pool that now has big stains  in the pool wall. Be very wary!","2016-02-10","0","tyCssupVwgCdt5Uq4lx3jw","BB1_5jqGRztfsCGw1fGMtA"

"Five stars because of their grapefruit beer with a shot for $10 deal. The shot includes anything from patron to Jameson and the grapefruit beer is super refreshing. Seems like a ghetto small spot from the outside but once you go in the back it's a nice hippie local ambience spot to chill with your buddies! Haven't tried the food but heard its great. Not necessarily a place to get rachet at but there's a teeter totter in the back that you can get drunk and try not to fall of:)","2014-04-05","0","3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw","E3UDFaFTiGX-g6wgsW77Lg"

Our waiter who I can only describe as WWF triple H with Down syndrome on a high carb diet showed up @ our table 3 times during a 1.5 hour meal! Manager worked more than the staff & a pizza took 45 minutes to prepare! Pizza ! You would think Gordon Ramsey was preparing the freaking pizza !

"Let me just start off by saying, I think the store is great. From the apparel to the accessories and gadgets. But I would NEVER give my business to this store in Boca Park because of the HORRIBLE customer service I received when I just went to pickup and return a job application. Stupid blonde bitch at the register was SO RUDE! I went to pick up the app and as soon as I walked in, all I got was a nasty look. No 'hello', 'welcome to Tillys', NOTHING.

"Poor Service:

Fulltimer from Texas traveling through the Vegas area. I called to schedule an appointment on December 2, 2014 and was told the next appointment was 2 weeks out on December 16, 2014. I was then asked if I purchased the RV from them, when I said I was from out of state and I hadn't purchased the unit at their dealer, I was told the next open appointment would be January 18, 2015, another month after the first quoted available service date.

"Unlike what RP says, they try their best to treat your sick pet even you can't afford recommended care.  I have been there twice with my cat and each time they offered me estimates and made sure I was ok with the costs.  One time I was able to do what they recommended because it wasn't too expensive but the next time I had to ask for a more conservative treatment plan because it was too expensive and they helped me out.

Water damage by tub, no heat for several days two times now, shoddy finish carpentry, scratched up counters, paint on your carpet, lighting fixtures damaged. Painters tape still on the exterior of the house where they never went back to fix the stucco and paint.

"This was a very cute shop! I brought my shepherd\/collie (Dakota) in as they were almost ready to close and was welcomed in. Randee (randy) was helpful and even gave me a small bag of food to try out! I got Dakota a large pupcake and bulldog bar for her birthday treat! She loved them! Even my kitties were interested in the pupcake. Of course I picked them up some salmon ""we pity the kitty"" treats and they also enjoyed those! I'll definitely be back!

Their prices are reasonable, and they offer discounts on your purchase which is great. They carry Indi remi, which is the most expensive brand they carry.

"We ordered for delivery a chicken Alfredo pizza and a ranch chicken wrap. It took over an hour when delivery time was supposed to be within 45 minutes. The pizza was pretty good although cold but the wrap was inedible. Cold, dry, and tasted old. Even my partner who can eat almost anything couldn't stomach it. Overall IF I order from them again I won't trust anything else but the pizza, which sucks because so many things on their menu sound delicious.","2014-04-23","0","rS3KdecMS-EF4H3VtmkxBw","RuZSfwY6wTs7ZrFO6UBk0A"

"We went to Ray Wold's Monday night comedy show during Christmas week and had a great time. When we first arrived it looked a little dead, so me and the others in my group where a little concerned. However, they made us feel welcome and at ease and put on a great show for us. If you're up for some a little different such adult clown comedy, a little singing, and hear some amature comedy acts this is a great show to see. Thank you Ray for putting on a fun and interactive show for us!","2014-01-11","0","OifjeICaQJeWUQWAKhxa8w","DLXAsA6Kvpj8SA5_szdjWA"

"Not as nice as the other time share resorts I've stayed in but nice enough.
The place is clean and not too out dated but might need to be updated within the next 5-8 years.
Bed is firm, would rather have a big fluffy bed to sleep in but it good enough... Overall I'm happy, but if I had a choice I would rather stay closer to the strip","2014-08-21","0","R43QH4FqHOOJapm5TaCEVg","VWYzHm2PfBniD3YDIPcyfA"

"It was really delicious. :) I frequent many Thai places in my home state of Oregon and love how consistent Thai flavors are. This place is awesome bang for buck. I do wish that they offered more Thai plates, though the addition of common Chinese flavors for pickier eaters is helpful. The appetizer calamari was done perfectly, not too oily, not over cooked, and not undercooked and calamari is really hard to nail. The pad Thai is ok, it's very fragrant, so it might turn away some people.","2014-03-24","0","hPclwunHi36YV8cPghWJBg","lo8Ut7b6dj6ikk_FNYQmbQ"

"Tip? Don't waste your time. Maybe they were having an off day but waiting for 20mins in cold water (pedi) then seeing someone come afterwards & get helped before me definitely ticked me off. Then the owner lied saying she had an appointment when everyone clearly heard the lady say ""I'd like to get a fill, is there a wait?"" Nobody asks that if they have an appointment. Needless to say I won't be going back there.

"Haven't had my massage yet, but here are some tips for the owner: 

You must consider adding a relaxation room. I have been sitting waiting for my massage listening to the receptionist and a massage therapist discuss the proper way to book clients... Not the most soothing convo!

Get new furniture: the couches look like they were picked up from a yard sale. It's not that much to invest in nice furniture for your business.

Now lets see how the massage is.. Hopefully better Thant waiting time.","2013-09-09","0","HYTqzvqIG9ehLKQWVKCp4w","q-56B575urwgRToD8sCU9Q"

Yes they are busy, and Tiffany the owner fills up QUICK! So best to make an appointment, but you won't be disappointed!!!","2015-07-08","0","ElZ0upBJAtCed5TEGh3xoQ","0S5Zs_Sj8GIOZse2TRKJKQ"

Steak sandwich over cooked & lacked flavor deep dish pizza was ok I would order again but with very very little sauce. we ordered garlic bread received something else which we didn't know until we got the bill but was good. soda was flat. so if you will go there I say order pizza with little sauce & make sure you get what you ordered and not something else that will cost more. & don't expect the best service or quality but ok on price","2013-09-11","0","yd0g-FRSAdP9YKm7Z8-uUw","BybPJpxTTul7tde-PIG75A"

"Wish I never signed a contract with sprint. In-store worst customer service ever. No sense of urgency what so ever after waiting close to 2 hours, for them not to even help me. Was given false information about a device from the get go, so now I'm stuck with a higher bill for something I don't even use. I was told after seeing the first employee that I wouldn't have to wait again to speak to a manager.

"I have lived in las Vegas for 19 yrs and I think the graveyard bartender Dan is one of the best local bartenders I have met in that time. I am a bartender at the flamingo and I go to eat drink and gamble after work since 2001. This guy makes you feel at home and like you are family! If it wasn't for the fluke that I stopped in on Dan's shift I would have never come back!

Food was same as Summerlin location. Chips and guacamole good but salsa watery and ok. Had carnitas taco which had no flavor and carne asada taco meat was old. Overall it was ok. Not rushing back.

"If you already know that you want to order their Volcano kimchi fried rice (minimum order of 2 for $7.99\/order) let the hostess know ahead of time so they can set your table with a different grill. Otherwise, they have to cook all the meats first and you have to wait til the end for the fried rice. I like to eat my meats with rice. I was just a little annoyed that I had to set my meat aside for the grill change and wait for the rice to cook","2016-06-06","1","aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw","7U2cOebWk-KZWhrlqCBIvA"

I messed up so bad that I never thought I'd get out of the vehicle. I contacted George about my issue and he assured me he'd do his best. Today he called me with a deal he thought could help me fix it all. And he was right! I left Gaudin just a short time later with a 2017 Ford Escape!

"TIPS and TRICKS
1. Get there early 

2. Be in dress code-swim attire. No jeans, jerseys, or athletic wear. 

3. Reserve a VIP area-daybeds, couches, and cabanas come with entry, no wait to get in, no rental fee, and just require you to meet a food an beverage minimum throughout the day. 

4.  MOST BENEFICIAL Contact a VIP Host-(like myself 702-494-7979) we'll be able to provide information on talent, pricing, and what's best for your situation. We're also physically at the venue.","2013-06-07","0","Al0uCu7s9LQEURwV1F6Bfg","7y9xossD3vSrerZsKwgLug"

"One stop shop for the best variety breads, cookies, sandwiches, jams, etc. This Great Harvest has reinvented the way you buy sandwiches by providing an upbeat classical and hipster vibe from the music to the ti-dye shirts on their backs. Your experience here will be second to none, once inside I guarantee you won't want to leave once you've embraced the rich delicious smells of fresh baked breads and treats or enjoy a mouth watering blueberry scone outside in the beautiful courtyard.","2013-09-11","0","ZgPnRzWjQR5NtiauGBww7g","IO5abJAOo9wtSlPLRgrbjQ"

"Not worth the time or the money. I ordered the corn beef hash and eggs over medium with a bagel. Man was I in for disappointment. The hash was burnt and mainly potatoes with what appeared to be the leavings of bacon bits sprinkled through it leaving it all but unedible, the eggs were rubbery overdone disks, and the coffee burnt. The only good thing was the bagel and I only say that because it seems it's the only thing the cook didn't take a flamethrower to.","2014-02-13","0","v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg","36PONpFDQtSNpGg3puuPCQ"

"Had 2 procedures, the place was packed, but they were on time to the minute and very nice.  Same with the second time.  The only draw back is the scheduling people.  They called me to make an appointment and when I called back, they couldn't find the referral.  She looked  at 3 different places and finally found it.  When my husband had a referral, they lost it totally and we had to get the doctor to send it again.","2017-08-28","0","q72Z67w9bRSPA5iRLN2zuA","bZdZkoeDkQ4bcwtD1WwKfQ"

"The ""loss of use"" coverage portion of the rental insurance they try so desperately to sell you is typically a perk offered by credit card companies (if you don't pay for it with your primary car insurance company). These people will check your insurance ID card and try to prey on you if they think you don't understand the coverages.

"$15 jameson\/gingers and $18 Dublin Donkeys!!  
We were appalled!  7 drinks, 3 shots... $125!!!  We confronted the server about it and she rudely told me how thats the policy because its double the alcohol. 
While the price was outrageous I would have been able to get over it if the environment was outstanding (our drinks were served in plastic cups) or the service (Erin was no where to be found half the time, and acted as if she hated her job).

"When purchasing to-go, ALWAYS ALWAYS double check your order. Even if the workers are busy, DOUBLE CHECK. Place two orders from this location, one time they forget my fries, and another time they gave me the wrong flavored wings. It's unacceptable but their management are always come up with a resolution and credit you in the future. Truly appreciate that, but would like it more when my order is right. Lesson learned, TWICE.

The veal is tender and always prepared perfectly. Try Zefferino style (yum). The pasta is wonderful, homemade and sauces great. Yes, it's expensive. If you're going to complain about paying for the wonderful memorable meal, don't go. This is the place where you definitely get what you pay for.","2016-07-26","1","qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA","IVs1BJOff5n3-Ymt3DSTxw"

"First of all, I go to this place quite often and its normally pretty decent.  This time was really different. I came in on a saturday for a sandwich, only to be informed they dont make sandwiches on the weekend.  I then ordered spring rolls, normally quite good, and they were all rice, barely any veggies or meat at all.  I also ordered a green tea boba, which i was told they are out of, disappointed again.

"OK, this is just a small tip with a full review to come later. 
Atmosphere: B+ (great pub feel)
Food: B (wifey's burger was good, my Fish n chips (minus the chips) were fantastic. They need to do something about their fries.
Value: B (solid value, decent deal)
Air Quality: D (we're not smokers and it was a little too rank and smokey for the nonsmoker)
Long story short? Great place to eat, drink, and watch sports IF you don't mind eating while the table next to you is occupied by a smoker.","2015-01-01","0","VvtBFDQhtF256Hh62m4gRQ","y46MS-ZA8UyHaVP3PpI3Ww"

"The original donuts are always fresh and delicious. If you order any other type of donut it's a crap shoot on quality\/freshness. I would not recommend their coffee, you're better off with Dunkin Donuts for that. Staff\/customer service is hit and miss, I would say average. Bottom Line: hit this place up if you are in the mood for original glazed donuts and grab your coffee somewhere else. :)","2014-04-03","0","aDQ2LO_JsIgJt1h26eq07A","b2l1PEw8ndoQlxzzIgeGCg"

I have since had the problem fixed by a reputable company for $100.00 plus part.  DO NOT HIRE!

I ordered the linguini and white clam sauce for my entree and it was absolutely delicious! My friends had veal Parmesan, and penne with barb's pomodoro sauce, which were equally adored. The only drawbacks were the gelato, which was good, but too expensive in our opinion, and the bitter coffee.

"We weren't impressed by the overall customer service, but their suite was the nicest room I've stayed in at Las Vegas.

****** Update from our experience above 3 years ago. 

We just spent Thurs-Sun at Aria, and the customer service was consistently warm, friendly, courteous, professional and prompt. 

The casino allows smoking, but the entire Sports Book area where my husband likes to hang out is NON-SMOKING!!!!!!! 

Aria is our new favorite place to stay in Las Vegas.","2012-04-14","0","SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg","KALVpXSkP_h5-WLg15X8NQ"

"I went to this place the other night with a friend because it was open late. The food was not bad, we ordered a sashimi platter to share and a roll or two. However we were not impressed at the 20% gratuity automatically added to our bill. We were a party of TWO, and I do not think that ""auto-gratuity"" is necessary or appropriate unless it's with a group of 4 or more. Tips should be based on SERVICE. And as a person who usually tips well, it left a bad taste in my mouth. I will not be returning.","2013-11-07","0","kUz5-7Nm-gzQAmvgvegbLg","ow6f-n18NVCpnR8e4-4tOg"
