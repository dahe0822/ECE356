"My very first time I went here they did an amazing job, very pleased with the outcome and service was nice and friendly. This time.. completely different. The employee working was obviously in a bad mood, and extremely rude espicially to the foreigners. As soon as this Indian family left, she loudly complained about how they shouldn't be allowed in the country and need to speak more clearly.. very dissapointed and am worried what they say about me. This will probably be my last visit","2013-08-21","0","A_PgZp2M63zWtnpNChpk-w","el5So-zwsck7hcQKcp084Q"

"I had a coupon for BOGO waffle cones. I usually only go to Bruster's when I have a coupon since ice cream is expensive! 

I had the birthday cake cone and my daughter had the chocolate chip cookie dough. The waffle cones are made on site, and are delicious. Crunchy and not too sweet. The birthday cake was pretty good. It is creamy and had chunks of vanilla cake and sprinkles. Never too old for cake!

"I have never had a manicure while at the pedicure station.I have always had to go rinse my hands but was handed a wet rag to wipe my hands . I finally asked if we could go to a table .I then went to the drying station ,noticed my toes were not cut the same length and there was a spot on the tip of my toe that wasn't even polished . She never tried to talk to me .There are good reviews but I will totally request not to be seen by her again ! I feel like I didn't even get a real treatment for 40$","2016-01-29","0","3cp_75QRfKJlDksPQxHgkQ","PXhZDe40L6SRRGLfZdkduQ"

"For some reason the gels here darkens on my nails and gives it this uneven dirty look after a few days....I don't understand. Its only when I get them done here. And my cuticles are a mess. They looked fine walking out the door but just four days later I noticed the discoloration. Its a shame because the staff is nice but if after not even a week this it what they look like I wont be able to return.","2017-04-04","0","n_dLeCjpH9VN26wazLr88Q","FOQoX1G_a2vqEk-koeqbAQ"

He was close to death, but she saved him and gave him extra love to nurse him back to health. Dr. Montgerard demonstrated the highest level of compassion and morality. She is very knowledgeable and will do everything in her power to help balance care and cost for your beloved pets! I highly recommend her.

"Super bummed they really scaled down their wine list with the new menu update. They used to have the best wine list in Plaza Midwood. Now it's not even listed on the menu, but they still carry one of each type & list 1 featured wine on the menu. Guess they're focusing more on their massive craft beer menu, which is super impressive, but girls still love their wine options.","2016-06-03","0","Cdk3wRR7TwJb1JW7agPJXw","KMokoIg-963M8ihKnglgmg"
"Really off their game tonight. I don't know what's wrong, but it's been the worst service we've ever had tonight. Which is no excuse, considering how slow it is here tonight. Maybe Moo & Broo stole some customers. But I've seen 2 tables walk out after waiting 10-15 for a server. Our server forgot an order, so we had to ask again. She never even realized she's forgotten to enter it. Super slow & very inattentive, which is so unusual for here.

"This Cheesecake Factory is more ""high end"" than some of the others I've visited, as well as the one portrayed on the Big Bang Theory. The prices are a bit high, but it's so worth it for the quality of food and service.

My favorite appetizer is the chicken samosas with a cilantro sauce. No fillers. Just curry chicken wrapped in a wonton. The creamy cilantro sauce is perfect with these. (My usual sauce is ranch)

Dinner wise it has to be the steak diane. Amazing, tender, covered in a yummy sauce!","2014-03-03","0","L8rJht4Jw_BuR8gsckEWYg","Chzcoy_mg6WQohk6WdeW4g"

"If you want real authentic ""old"" Charlotte this is the place.  In NC terminology, a sundries store was a neighborhood store that sold a little of everything, back when people didn't drive everywhere.   A sundries store often had a soda fountain.

This place keeps the name and the history, but is primarily a sports bar and local watering hole.   

Service was attentive and friendly, food was only so so.","2014-01-22","0","SXQEYB5qR_y8LNQUsGKHhA","7UGQRE87Kfk9ifrE_FILZw"

"Great experience. I made an appt through this app and unfortunately I wasn't on the schedule when I got there on a Saturday morning. However, the team was very accommodating and the receptionist was very kind. I had to wait an hr to see the dr, which was unfortunate, but again I wasn't originally on the schedule. My tip is to call first to make sure you're on the actual schedule. I'm assuming this appointment feature is new so they haven't figured everything out. Overall, highly recommend.","2016-12-10","0","47mT4gCYbRjOpgVqTUc49w","9oHMdDcXdtUjVaAokRrjsg"

Wholly expensive for fast food; calling this fare ""fast food"" is polite. Two sandwiches and a kids chicken fingers was over $30. Food is sloppy and greasy; Styrofoam cups; dirty, greasy tables.

"My coffee was great, but my food was OK & I had a bunch of up charges.  Up charge for fruit, ok, but if I pay $2.50 for fruit, I think I should get a decent amount... Picture shows  fruit in soup cup less than half full... It is missing 2 grapes I ate before pic.  
Service was not great either, no spoon brought with my soup so had to get up and get own.  Husband brought wrong soup & when this was pointed out no sorry or anything, just new soup brought out no word.","2013-05-05","0","aBLx9JlAMq_AuW6VAImSwg","GZpuNbcm-8Wna8cN3VvmXA"

It was 11:45pm. I called, and they said my only option was to come all the way back for the 2 nuggets. I asked it I could come by tomorrow and they said their policy is to only fix orders ""same day"". So I was supposed to speed all the way back, waste my time and gas, because of their error?

"Hadn't been here in about 20 years, not sure why. Just popped into my head today and very glad it did. The Gorganzola Bleu Cheese dressing on the salad was fantastic as was the Chicken Parmigiana Alfredo. Crisp, pounded chicken breasts over fettucini was simply amazing. Atmosphere akin to 'bar scene' in Goodfellas...Frank, Dean on the jukebox, darkened interior, obviously a local joint but service was good and friendly and I sure won't wait another 20 years to go back.","2013-04-06","0","HadzjG0pPrqH-t7Yv1MEKA","tNHyMRIcW7sCrD_d7emCDQ"
"Love the atmosphere and the service was prompt and friendly but found the food quite pricey.  The Lake Perch was quite good with a crunchy breading but bland.  I got steamed broccoli which was steamed to perfection.  Our salads were good but the house dressing was a plain oil and vinegar and very bland. My husbands chicken parm was small and smothered with so much cheese it was practically impossible to find the chicken under it.  The rigatoni was just OK.","2015-02-05","0","HadzjG0pPrqH-t7Yv1MEKA","2B3jcHw-C1qnL7aWp8OQxw"

Had it again the next time. Same result. Can't finish it. But (high-pitched) SO good. 

We made ourselves order small plates for the third visit. Eating the wedge salad with candied tomatoes and crispy pork belly and bleu cheese schmearo dressing was fun. That pork belly did its job. And the flavors are all great. Try it.

Hanging from the ceiling, and lots of other race merchandise too! And great place for the kids!  They give the kids a free cardboard car they can assemble themselves!

They cleaned the place up a bit which is nice and the food was fine but the servuce was painfully slow. I was with one other person and there were maybe four other tables in the whole place. We sat for 10 minutes before our server came to our table. Waited another 20 minutes after we put our order in.

So I had to find out from my online updates.When I called she neglected to even apologize and said it was ""nothing"".LEARN SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

Got charge $30 more on 5 different ridiculous taxes and got put on a nonsmoking room as I requested but it was nasty smoking smell. Manager comment I'm sorry but you booked with Expedia. What does that has to do with us being in a room that smelled nasty like smoke. First and last stay.

"I love this place.  Every time I'm in, jean greets me like we've known each other for years.  She knows what a quality cupcake should taste like and delivers that!  I'm a foodie and love exotic flavors but I've never been so content with just vanilla until now.  All her flavors are great and the quality never suffers.  I've been to dozens of bakeries looking for the best cupcake and I have to say these are pretty much perfect and local at that!","2014-07-29","1","YKPyXaEZwDJOzB5-7gbCkA","YPuqj40fiBpLphzGWfJ6Sw"

"I found out that this is the only location north of Tennessee. I was skeptical when I saw all they do is chicken fingers but I was pleasantly surprised. Fingers are lightly battered and have a good flavor to them. I recommend the box which comes with fries, fresh cole slaw, garlic toast and 5 fingers. They are also reasonably priced!","2013-04-13","0","OCxl56kc8QcxxA-uLxNfIw","Vj6BCU6RKscBfeSv1gn6hw"
"This place opened up in the former Hoggy's location in Valley View. The atmosphere is nice and what i have sampled so far the food is way better than Hoggy's bland (IMHO) selection was.

"Went here several years ago and we were meeting friends recently and this was a good half way point to do so.  Upon entering on a Friday after work we sat at a table (and there are few tables) and waited. Eventually went to the bar only to be told there is no table service.  We were having food so that was a slight problem.   The food here is actually good but it seems like they really could care less if you eat here.  One other couple walked in  and since nobody came to the table they left.","2016-12-31","0","mYFVOkv4UgtRaS3xMY-tvA","R-Yp8T-0BAdO4KQ_ODE92w"

The only thing that worked was the drinks. Guess it's hard to mess that up. What an epic failure.","2015-11-05","0","_2iPJy_nNDkez2jSqa40xg","k4FLgThOaqbtFu6OExYbHg"

There was a dirty table and an open one and we were told it would take 15-20 min to clean the dirty one off (apparently the clean one wasn't allowed to be use?!?! Idk) did I mention it was dead in there? The girl said it was too busy to clean off the table quicker....(pffftt) so we decided to sit inside instead. After 15 min of waiting for a server and still not seeing one we left and found elsewhere to go.","2013-07-21","1","0youcKV6-eE3F2MQj1l6Fw","XjRdO_6k8bqaeVJ3m5gROw"

I mad an appointment about three to four hours before the time for pictures and i was almost late if i didn't just leave bc of how horrible she did my updo. I literally started to do my hair myself at one point bc she couldn't braid my hair since it was a silk texture? like cmon even if it was she kept blaming my hair so i jumped in and started braiding it myself for her to tell me she's got it. It was the worst $70 plus 5 tip i've spent","2017-01-18","0","RWuBxf3RBG73gFTi_ZVodA","vseZqQrg6zkkB4pEwlFSQw"

"This place is a rip. I took my DC24 Limited Edition Blueprint Dyson in because the brush wasn't moving. When I went to pick it up, the owner says to me ""you know when you fixed something but you don't know what you did to fix it?"" I had no clue what that meant so I said, ""so, what was wrong with it??"" Then he said ""well, sometimes when the reset button is not back in it's original position the brush won't move""

Girl at counter was very friendly and handled the order no problem

"Help with ordering:

Foie gras mousse: a must. Perfect flavor combination. Decadent so it's fine to share.

Rabbit rillete: see above. 

Wagyu beef: huge portion so also good if you're sharing. Delicious!

Rabbit: underwhelming I thought. Sausage overpowers the taste of the rabbit. But that amazing polenta makes up for it!

Veal neck: very tasty, similar to a brisket

Sfingi: PERFECT dessert to share. 5 large donuts make it great to pass around your big group. Just needs vanilla ice cream.","2015-05-05","1","OoI3WUe4Xl86d53avy3oVA","M_UuEwc_HoqPhqgEzkjPrg"

"The place is small and cramped. Tables and chairs are shared so if you get stuck at an obnoxious table, too bad. There are only four tables, so there likely won't be much, if any, flexibility. It also makes for an awkward experience with people trying to isolate themselves and ignore the rest while sitting at the same table.... Overhearing embarrassing stories and drama can be rather entertaining, though. Also, there is NO ATM inside, so be sure to get your cash somewhere else beforehand.","2014-11-30","0","IXXERocY1bqGwRllcy8J2w","AR7Zj2n7TMM3jTohKR7rxw"

"The white chocolate latte was yummy. I do not typically order lattes, so it was a nice change. I also had a honey wheat bagel, which I did not love. It's too huge for one person and a waste. 

The place was not busy at all and was not as clean as it should have been. The bin with the used trays sat there for over 30 minutes and I didn't see anybody wipe down a table. 

I probably would not go back.","2014-04-05","0","c0exbGNQvCDJZLorPeYY7Q","glpbbuEaHgwPOraqRPaAQg"
"The spinach apple salad was perfect. Crisp and full of flavor and just the right amount of dressing.  The pilsner was great as well. Also tasted the burger and potato chips and they were both a hit.

"New favorite Vietnamese restaurant here in Arizona. 
Service: Typical service that you can expect from these hole in a wall asian joints. Most of the employees don't speak much English but are very good at making sure you got what you need and your drink is filled. 
Food: This is why you come here. The pho broth is my favorite. Not much has to be added to it unless you like your pho spicy. The egg rolls and spring rolls are good too, portions are small compared to some of the other ones in town.","2013-04-22","0","Jj8ubiwwuCR-rrhrrjcryw","9RTgJLwZkbKHivuvUrtrlg"

The young waiter took my order who has bad English; he talks to much and try to say some funny things. And then, after taking my order he got his phone out and keep texting. Stop waste my time. I just have 30 minutes for my lunch. The service always takes so long. I don't have time to waste at all.

I'm never coming here again.","2013-11-11","0","8ysapimCImBSDKl28qIrjA","ebvRvsfqxZHmDPTqOeTSJw"
"Authentic Mexican place, mariachi music and all! Kind of an older mexican 5 & diner, but very clean.
May be family owned.
Ordered the fish tacos, well made hot and tasty. I  like that they serve the sauce on the side so you can watch those calories. Chips were good, and a great selection of sauces and beer. Definitely would go again!","2013-11-23","0","jVXa8Qzn5BehtN2iEVJNHw","28OoDs4CalQmrreqyx4jYA"

"I forgot to add something I really don't like about Loss Compadres... the seating... we sat at large table. The chairs were low to the table and not comfortable at all... there are no booths, which is almost such a disappointment, it makes me not want to eat here, and I hesitate to bring friends here. I have said this at least 10 years ago and nothing has changed. Take some of the money you make and put some comfortable booths, or at least some comfortable tables and chairs.

"This is as recent as 10\/20\/2015 at 3:36am. THIS PLACE IS NO GOOD! Bums hang out all times of business hours and (not even to ask for money but because this is the hang out spot for them).  The place reeks of bum smell soon as you walk in. The service is no better. My grits,(which was the reason I got up at 3 in the morning to even go to this dump) were hard as hell, food cold,etc. you'll have a better experience at ihop down the street","2015-10-20","0","LRWNY71pO1KVOK3P6kam8A","6HerG0xPJEoj8gBq9_QqMQ"

"I go to this place frequently. Usually on Sundays where it's a cluster at every bar in this area. Music is loud which definitely helps with awkward silence, lots of bass that literally moves you. Drinks are reasonably priced for the location and compared to other bars nearby.

"First time here and so far it's a nice experience.  Chicken wrap is good along with the potato salad, but I'm curious now if I should have ordered Crepes instead.

Overall, it's a nice place to study since I'm kinda growing tired of my usual Starbucks location. Wifi is fast with speed test coming back with 23.57 Mbps, faster than my home connection even at Preferred Account with Cox. 

I'll definitely return and perhaps try the Crepes.","2013-11-10","1","n6IWvkVMWB9OIRZBXh5tHw","lJs0dvwGKlcPrxekJKyzUQ"
