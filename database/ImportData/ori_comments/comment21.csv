This is a mom & pop shop, not a popular place to stop but this is the real home made flavor of Greek food!  Not a watered-down chain version.

My gyro and salad had all the bold flavor of Mediterranean food.

It is so great to find this kind of places!!!","2013-07-19","0","PRUtZy3DUl4sPOisYfOAuw","q07Bb6swWSPvAn0VwA2YTA"

"So i just found out if u buy a pound of carne asada it cheaper then buy by taco. For example. 10 tacos is like 20 bucks. Which is less then 1\/2 a pound of meat. If u get two pounds it comes out to 24 bucks. The meat is still cooked and u still get everything u would if u asked for tacos. The difference is u have to make the tacos ur self. So u end up paying so much more just to have them put the meat on the torrtia. Hope this helps.","2013-06-05","0","4VPjBVJKcxDpr00OMwxSww","WyJem4y8g5ZpZ0umAHIicQ"

"My tip for you is stay far away from this place as possible. Management and this place is a joke. Neighbors upstairs are noisy and disrespectful and the staff are very unorganized unprofessional and rude. Read all reviews and you'll see why. You will be very unhappy here and regret spending and wasting money here. They ignore your complaints and concerns, they don't do anything about what needs to be fixed. I wish I read the reviews before moving in. I highly regret it.","2016-08-21","1","E_PtOvRUw4qKY5lndbyLKQ","o80TQJ9g-MxNDwL5P8Je8Q"

He replied to find out what the problem is. When I clearly stated the muffler broke which is why I needed a replacement. He then responded well I need to diagnose it because idk what year make and model it is and that's how we can give a quote. Like I couldn't tell him.

"First time here.  Having the Alligator Po Boy with Gumbo for the side. Gumbo is good lacking andouie sausage so its not authentic tho the sausage they use has a good smokey flavor.

"We have tried lots of Chinese restaurants in the area and this has become our favorite.  The customer service is impressive. We ordered the kung Pao beef not realizing it was breaded and fried instead of sauteed. We really didn't care for it and called to order something else. While it was our error they kindly took our new order and delivered it free. The volcano beef is amazing and they have always made sure we enjoy our meal, whether it was delivered or we have dined there.

"They recently changed the juke box selections so don't come here if you like any sort of hard rock or metal; even mainstream stuff, like Metallica and Ozzy were removed. The Jukebox music is also much quieter and I think, more so if you listen  to any kind of rock. I think they are trying to make this a beatnik kinda place where everyone snaps their fingers.

"Its so sad to me that people can get on here and write such horrible things. Sandy and Cosmo are two amazing hairdressers that taught me so much as a hairdresser and I know for a fact if anyone had a problem with how their hair was done they would go out of there way to take care of you. As for people thinking the people who work there are snotty... they are classy high end hairdressers who do their makeup and get well dressed for their clients that should be appreciated not dogged on... ;)","2013-09-04","0","ffb-MG6KFRzYCERrWi2htw","yYWjMRTLyQf66LuyRKqbQw"

"I had a girl from Cosmos Beauty Salon come to my house and do my hair, her name was Maddie. I had the worse experience ever, not to mention she cussed me out and and told me she didn't give a f*** if I didn't like my hair and that I still owed her money. I will never recommend this place to anyone. 
My hair was orange and completely uneven. Very poor communication skills, and I can't believe Cosmos would hire someone like this.","2016-03-04","0","ffb-MG6KFRzYCERrWi2htw","37ed8VolAd7vjQTiif2hiw"

"I'm new to Yelp but have been doing business with this company for 5 years to create many awards each year. Lots of last minute deadlines and special needs and have never once encountered any of the prior reviewers issues. In fact, it has been quite the opposite, timely communication and a few freebies thrown in for our charitable functions.

After 25 various products I am yet to be even slightly disappointed. On time and on budget.

"I have been to this thrift store numerous times, since I moved to the north Mesa area about a year ago. While I'm sure the Children's home is wonderful, the prices at the thrift store\/boutique are outrageous! Because of the ridiculous prices (specifically home goods, decor, furniture) at both the boutique and store, the store is packed and rarely moves merchandise off of the floor while 90% of their donated items sit outside rotting in the elements.","2016-03-30","0","Aoy8tyaIqgAihjU1Vwh6rQ","8HDxprzFlZnHNVIGMVFUDA"

"We were regulars. After one bad visit, we waited 4 months to try again.
When we got there, there was one truck already waiting for his order. Ordering wasn't easy, she kept asking me to repeat. I asked her if they still put on jalapeños, she said yes. We waited 15 minutes and the guy ahead finally got his order, one small bag. 
Our order included a sandwich with no jalapeños (which the receipt said they charged me for) with half-charred dry meat on top, of which I've never seen at Arby's before.","2015-11-13","0","zeY04IdSTpTidD0ewUqnbA","k3x_G_qwGDywT6QIzE75xQ"

We have been in 5 different times for various reasons. Each time we have been very disappointed with the staff at this location. They lack compassion for the animals, are rude to customers, and try to up charge you on everything. We are really disheartened with our experiences here.","2016-06-09","0","fDA0cuH_IUFDxOZ2ihj9PQ","H_8bxoxLZ7XgTY2NkhTMaQ"

It was not busy, I have come when they are busy and they have been on their game. Today was not the case. Several people left due to the extremely long wait, just for someone to even say hello. They had little to no bagels, other people were upset they didn't have their usual bagel choice. The girls behind the counter were frustrated and it was easily seen on their faces.","2016-11-13","0","XEMoBJcgavYQxOrWM-YAvA","wzRqGy5vMwindXj3VAvL1g"

I walked in and let them know what happened, Frank, the technician, immediately stopped what he was doing and started to fix my car.  He quickly worked to repair the problem, filled my radiator fluid, and then they told me to have a nice day!  You may think this is no way to run a business, but I beg to differ.

"I really love this spot, it's so convenient and Kim is great!  It's a private spa so you get one on one attention in a private room without all the annoyance of other spas sending 3 or 4 different people to do your nails.  The privacy is great and much faster than your typical nail shop because you have one person attending to you continuously, no shuffling back and fourth!  Much better!","2014-07-24","0","SOPXi9TFSXn5eV3wJxM_Bg","fk-jBk1cFF9rsU7Mt-bV2g"

I may have to plan a trip around that soon!","2014-03-24","0","VMr8sgoQOW0fo0qVJENajA","RmcYkLf5HqMrAmw77hmoAA"

We were looking for a new adventure and hadn't tried the Venezuelan twist on food so we took this place for a spin!  
AWESOME!!!
Then as we were leaving  we stopped in the ART of Flavor gelato store a door or two down and had the most amazing Gelato store I have found since I visited Italy!  
Two thumbs up!!!","2013-12-14","0","EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A","RmcYkLf5HqMrAmw77hmoAA"

"Attended a one day course on Sauce preparation.  The class was over-crowded, the chefs were relatively inaccessible, and the place was over-run with ""student"" chefs who added little or no value to the learning experience. Conceptually the course was a good idea. ..the execution was awful.  33 of us crowded around one stove...a joke for sure.","2015-12-07","0","JWgZJXtsaztb84RVCCoC9A","8r7kL3vkKDtk_2pOwmJQNA"

"I wouldn't recommend Queens. I dont like to give bad reviews but after 2 visits here it's hard not to. I got acrylics. The polish wasnt done well at all and I had to go back a few days after to get a chipped nail fixed. Again the polish job wasn't good. I switched to AZ Tip & Toes..

What I learned is if they put your engine in your car and don't give it back as it arrived as you requested then you should call the cops on them, request a report that they ruined your property and refuse any and all service from them.

Ordered the salmon with a corn butter sauce and mashed potatoes...told the waitress that I needed it gluten free and she brought me salmon over some veggies and white rice on this tiny little plate.  It tasted like something I make in 20 min at home... And it was $17.00! The manager argued with me, took my half eaten salmon, and said he just wouldn't charge me. This place was so ridiculous...my husband even got his food 10 min before I got mine. Crap place.","2014-08-01","0","34VuBMNaG9nJiyqsnoEgPg","OM47w9NM8oDJfVsWPJO8wg"

"Looking forward to our second honeymoon at this highly praised resort.  Husband booked 2 months in advance and even upgraded to a king bed suite.  When we arrived, they gave us two full beds in a little room that look like Motel 6 for $500\/ night and refused to give us any bigger bed.  It completely shattered my romantic vison of a dream vacation and leave me a bad impression of Arizona.  I hate this place and will never ever come back here AGAIN!!!!The place is way overpriced and overhyped.","2014-02-21","0","PsTzoIERiCjq6QHrOnk2Lg","CsGAb8AiRAxzPxutco-paQ"

Literally would not let the patient into exam room until paid in full cash. Asked to go outside to visit in an Empy waiting room with my daughter!

"Croissants are a must have--unless you are anti-nirvana. Unfortunately, being a creature of habit, it seems like all I ever order is the filet Mignon. It's my favorite steak. They always bring it hot hot hot to your table. Medium is a hot pink center, not too red, still juicy. 

Bleu cheese I believe is house made--delish.

Drinks are the best.  No real happy hour($1 off all drinks) so they don't go into the cheap well drinks.

"Just stopped in tonight with my boyfriend. We were both really hungry and I read good reviews and keep seeing commercials on tv so I thought we should try it out. Upon entering, we both noticed how fancy it was, but the menu looked like a Fast food combo menu and not to fancy. The food was very bland and not even worth taking to go. My boyfriend is always willing to eat anything, but hated his food. Service was slow as well and there wasn't many people there. Would not recommend","2013-09-19","1","a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g","IhbfHxnvrwB2SHXK4buM7Q"

"the salt cellar is  by far  the best place to eat  seafood in the valley. the halibut  is from  Alaska  and  right now they  are serving halibut cheeks. halibut  cheeks  are  these  little medallions  of  heaven....  lightly dusted  with rice flour (gluten free)  and topped  with caper  butter.  the  best  dinner I  have had since last time we went  to the salt cellar.

"Maybe it's because I live in the excellent beer city of San Diego, but I was definitely underwhelmed by the Four Peaks Brewing company. I suppose if there are no other breweries near-by then it would do in a pinch. The beer isn't bad. The food was less than desirable. The ""beer bread"" is basically a flour tortilla. Nothing special by any means. The pasta salad looked like somebody ate it and threw it up onto my plate. Needless to say we won't be going back. On a side note: our server was good.","2013-05-25","0","JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA","szex1-aNvG37akHorl8eTA"

"Went to the Tempe improv to see a show but by far the most entertaining portion of the night was the bar tender Jacob T.  Not only was he funny and always serving drinks with a smile, but he was very handsome too .  The drinks he made were fresh and delicious and he kept them coming! Can't wait to go back for another show and hopefully get to watch Jacob behind the bar! Would recommend to friends, small groups, or large occasions.","2015-08-30","0","qX116WMOppAblGKxoQwlYA","YYTgfKDiTWJ0bx3LuRP9OQ"

Be aware, however, if you go to see a movie that has been out for awhile they might shuffle you into one of their Star Class theaters without the option of regular seating. You wind up paying $3 extra for each ticket and there are no other seating options. Seating in the Star Class theater is great if you are on a date but super awkward if you are with a group as the seats are arranged in twos.

One downside the OJ was $6 and in a small glass. Dishes were $14 and $12 each so not a cheap meal but tasty!","2013-08-04","0","ndXuzuD4BpNIrm1I0nTsww","Z_B765Sin-hho6ULlK2hZQ"
"Delicious! I purchased two cupcakes on my way home today: blueberry lavender and white chocolate chip. Both attractive and tasty. The presentation and amount of icing is similar to other cupcake shops in the valley. Cupcakes are always sweet so not sure why people are pointing that out when it should be! I don't need a lot of frosting but it's easy to take off what you won't eat. One time I went at end of day & there were limited selections available but that was ok. Better to have freshly made","2013-04-19","0","46wGC_Xek4bWxx9dQvtlDQ","Z_B765Sin-hho6ULlK2hZQ"

"I love bikram yoga. I recommend people to try it. The quality of my life has improved with continued practice and the teachers are so motivating.  It is just a practice,  with the same 26 postures. The poses are all functional poses, no comprimising positions. There is no expectations and no disappointments.  For me, the hardest part is walking through those doors,  but I always feel better after.  This is truly an investment for your health and everyone should try it at least once!","2014-05-20","0","aNRX0ryN0r1nBCux1V01BA","Mq9H-inmBEa94yV4lRgFUw"

The only thing I recommend is not to board the hot air balloon first because then you will be under the flames and it will be a burning sensation through out the whole ride.

"Terrible. The female barber was hesitant on what I asked for (it was a basic haircut). Results were poor. Worse part was, it was a ten dollar haircut. I gave her a 20. Before getting my change, I handed her two dollars for tip. As I counted my change, she thanked me for coming, put her hand on my back and guided me out the door. I thought strange for her to want me out so quickly. When I counted my change, I received 8 dollars back instead of 10.

Some contemporary mixed with some traditional mixed with a bar that resembles a frat house and lastly add in big screen TVs and sports paintings on the glass storefront.

Perfectly crisp tortilla, each bite was consistent with the chili, chicken, cheese and pico de gayo. They know to serve it hot and perfectly folded so you have one side open so it doesn't spill or leak on your clothes. The taste is excellent!

"I grew up in the west valley and have likely driven by this location numerous times in the past, never taking notice. It is my new favorite. My wife and I made the trek from Buckeye passing a myriad of place I have stopped at and called a favorite for three decades. The shrimp coctail was spectacular giving evidence of the best parts yet to come. The mole (chicken) and barbacoa exceeded every expectation. These amazing bonuses were only further highlighted with the fresh homemade tortillas.","2014-09-12","0","4cyhLsjKxhC0x5AjYjZBDw","bRpK-hahywo3YdhRIIYogg"

"took a lab spaniel mix here quite a while ago. I wanted her shaved to 1\/4 inch, nails trimmed, filed, & glands. She wasn't ready ontime, because they did NOT shave her. They hand clipped her & left her coat long. ( they said that's the way they thought she should look) & did not do her glands.  I should have gotten what i asked for! I've had this dog shaved for years! Shes mixed breed, not a show dog!  There was no reason not to follow my instruction This cost too much for a job not done.","2013-09-26","0","lyD0bb7YgUlZXfvKTIIP1A","fJUHz-sncCt-UxvL8opaXw"

"The food is very good. I've eaten at other Mongolian BBQ and was shocked to see how the small the bowls were...HOWEVER... the meat and veggies are the only items you place in the small bowl. Then when you take it over to be BBQ'd they add your choice of starch (rice, noodles, etc). In the end it is a lot of food and there is no need for a all you can eat bowl. Overall very good.

Surprisingly the food was good. Nice and hot typical American style diner breakfast that we thoroughly enjoyed. Large servings. My sausages were over cooked crispy which is luckily exactly how I like it and the ham and bacon were perfect. I will go againand hopefully the food will be just as good.","2014-03-29","0","AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw","4t-f-Cs-DjbIZcuaCBvjhw"

I went across the street and got a reasonable quote at Lowes. Why bother with Uptight?","2014-05-17","0","PO8N9cmuayaDDWuR0S_1ug","tfUqyd7G97Vsm6HGKZqNmA"

However,  they open at 5 a.m. and close 11 p.m. and when it's summer in Arizona its nice to do your laundry at 5 a.m.  The washers are little bit deeper than the other laundromats in the area so I actually was able to  do   three loads in two loads and it only cost me $4 or $2 each load.

Took them an hour to reassemble the car (should have been 15 min max).  At the next place they called me to inspect the car... it seems Sun Devil did not like my departure as their tech DELIBERATELY damaged the parts.  With my own eyes I saw the damage on both wheels.

"Watch out for the social scam. We came in on a social promotion. The food was great. The wine pairing was wonderful. The manager tried to pull a fast one with the deal. The dinner included two glasses of wine. Menu price $9. Bottle $25. We inquired about upgrading to a bottle and were told they could do 50 percent off. We agreed. The bill came, the manager changed it to $6 off the bottle. Mary, our waitress was a star. This was clearly not her.

The people who sat on either side of me were very social and we had a great conversation.

"Overall, a great deal! It is a small buffet, and obviously some things are better than others. But there is a good selection, and the Philly cheesesteak station was awesome! Great variety on the salad bar. You can make your own sandwich. Plenty of hot dish options, with a lot of variety. Quite a few dessert selections to choose from as well, including sugar-free options.

"Went last night to experience this local restaurant. Looked good going in, aroma good, white linens, and small number of tables. 

We had the only child, our 2 year old grandson, with his patents. Service was quick to take drink orders and deliver with bread. Then nothing for over 30 minutes. Noticed a table placing orders that arrived after us. So, we walked out never knowing if it was any good.

Others with children came and left as there's no room to wait. 

They'll need to stick to catering!","2013-04-13","0","JTBxVGHe_fPZkfBN_EkA1Q","BPt-pkkz6FwJyTJSZRRwmw"

"Visiting from out of town and was excited to try this place for Sunday brunch, sadly didn't get a chance to. Can't get a table until after you order food (waitstaff will kick you out from the table if you try to hold while others are in line.) We had a party of six and they only had two 6-seat tables that were ended up occupied while in line and the rest of the place was packed as well. We didn't have wait for up to an hour for a big table to open so we decided to go elsewhere.","2015-05-31","0","5eK_pgro9_LxPYDoRVJnEA","4oE40ZRFsaeHIVL2vhz6rg"

"Disappointing. I first went here for an auto accident and I signed a form for cash payment. My insurance wasn't billed. For 3 months of treatment I was billed over $3000!!! I asked for a discount and fought to get 20%. 

My hubby then went & Dr Nash herself negotiates all pricing. She only charged him $350! And billed our insurance who also paid per visit. None of my EOBs seem correct & I know Ive overpaid!!

Never will Dr Nash get my referrals again.","2014-03-29","0","4KUNqxyCapMn1LAcRFHzcQ","UTixYttmKZM-7lzvjU20qw"

Love the Fried chicken & bacon infused waffles and Biscuits and gravy with mashed potatoes & eggs. The portions are huge.
