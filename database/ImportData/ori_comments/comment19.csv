"The bad reviews here all truthful. I had similar experiences with blonde highlites that turned into an orange mess. He got nasty when asked to fix, wanting more money. Explains why he's no longer on The Strip at the high end properties! They won't tolerate his deplorable work. This guy only will take cash, no cards which leads one to believe he's evading taxes too. We ladies should report him to State of Nevada Cosmetology Licensing Board. He needs more than re-training!","2017-02-11","0","nhEm1bgY41viqYcOmGicow","NpslUl76ZGtlzb9QdZUT-A"

"As a first time renter, SSRI made moving in a breeze. Their application process was easy and the rent is comparable to homes in the area. If I have any issues with anything in the home, they respond within 48hrs and it's taken care of soon after. The occasional walk-throughs are done professionally and quickly. They always give plenty of notice too. When I am ready to buy a home, I will definitely use this company.","2014-02-24","0","jS61OypBDohXfUfvjBV3CA","6nG_bwcTR5PodwXxUoRkXw"

"I have had the nastiest experience at their hair salon a few years back. I left the salon looking worse then before she did all the work on me. I will not go into details, but pay attention to the person doing your hair and make sure you feel completely comfortable with her\/his way of doing things.I should have known that her telling me that she cannot get the highlights too close to my roots is going to be an issue.I been getting highlights for over ten years.My haircut was a joke too.

"One of my favorite fast-food places, but not in this particular location. When i stepped in, there was an awful sewer stench. The gentlemen taking my order was friendly. The condiment station doesnt seem well maintained. As a friendly advice, dont trust those hand-pump ketchups. If its CO2 dispensed like at Raising Cane's, those are good.

I have watched the other patients as well, and I can say that Dr. Mehdi is one of the most caring, loving, and inspirational doctors I have ever met.

"Don't go with them.  They do a bait and switch. I received a flyer for Special #1 - $2,595. Was quoted this on the phone. Then when he came out, bait and switch. He said whoever quoted did not know what they were talking about. Really?  I called twice and was told the same price. I think once they get to your house they determine the price based upon your house and what you drive. Slimy salesman and business model. Not ethical at all. Would not do business with them or give them money.Warning!!!","2017-11-11","0","FGUdVlWfkoBbLZOIuEntNA","DDkWTND_6qjgq737MayAvw"

"If you can only play one course choose Sun Mountain. I have been playing these tracks since the late 90's. Grounds are heavily watered do not expect the typical LV fairway roll; 7000 yards plays 7000 yards. Fair and challenging tee boxes for women. Choose these courses over Reflection Bay. Always swing hard. Do not drink hard liqueur if temp is above 90 choose beer or candied drinks instead.","2013-05-01","0","oyluXrwjEp0EUIKJguGmDA","mynqFfV_vyNJCiKnp9b75A"

"The lobby is spacious and beautifully decorated ; the design types will spot out the 20+  Rococo white chairs and silver metallic paint arms. The fitness center is tucked into a corner just right of the reception desk.

There are two dozen treadmills\/step machines fitted with monitors and iPod\/iPhone chargers....I wonder if the Apple engineers realized the millions of devices and chargers that would not fit the iPhone 5. Same for the fancy player charger on the night stand.

"I was really impressed by the food. Artichoke salad was amazing and Sat night pasta special, rigatoni Nonna delicious and artichoke chicken was really great. What was disappointing was that it seemed like too much work for our server to split our food for us before bringing to the table. I had to do it myself, awkward with a small table for two. And the sever didn't want to accommodate my request for the pasta course to be served before the main course. We also had the tiramisu which was meh.","2014-03-30","0","46JVW4pwLDRIye4gYJboSw","diggyGlNTLE1H0B5MqR02A"

"This place is incredible. The baked Brie is great for an appetizer and the Caprese salad has pine nuts! Tonight I had an amazing meal, filet oscar, a 8ish oz filet which sat in a red wine reduction topped with succulent crab and rich Bearnaise sauce. I substituted the mashed potatoes for their ridiculous mushroom risotto. My wife had eggplant Parmesan which is different than other places and so much better. They shave the eggplant thin like lasagna noodles and layer it with cheese.","2014-08-08","0","eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ","2eO06I7aNyB7SFLcp_aAng"

"Wow!!! First AYCE sushi restaurant was amazing. Atmosphere was great.  Really cozy.  Rolls were filled!  The chef is extremely fast so I'd caution ordering a lot at once because they can fill you up quite quick.  Take your time,  look at the menu,  and ask one of the great servers to explain the specialty rolls if your curious.  We now have a list of rolls we try. Left happy and extremely full.","2015-07-26","0","Bm8nRUsZ-dK6g2eJLxMTOw","PoWq4I3BTAk1NpTYqoso5w"

"Dr Mabey is wonderful as a doctor and has been for many years. He delivered my first child 23 years ago. He's a great listener and is non-judgmental. He is deserving of more than 5 stars...sadly, it's the long time receptionist he's had that makes the experience less than welcoming. She's been there about 20 years and she's rude. Today she told me that she doesn't look into the insurance and she wouldn't know what my copay would be. Really? Well then how do you paid? Real nice.

"Whenever I contemplate getting pizza, a large factor in the decision is always the inevitable bloated, greasy sensation I endure afterward. Northside Nathan's proves you can enjoy fine quality pizza without suffering the mozzarella guilt. I ordered the 6-inch Nicely Nicelys pizza, which contained a soothing, but not overwhelming portion of mozzarella, tender slices of chicken, mushroom overtones, and a slight hint of garlic. Sports bar atmosphere might scare you off, but it's not too abrasive.","2013-08-30","0","Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ","IZt1A-_ZNEIPuiPV7aAKSA"

Gave me ROUND nails without even asking what I wanted then had to fix them.. Every nail is a different length.. He then asked what time it was and zipped through polishing my nails.. I have polish all over.. I'm disgusted","2013-06-02","0","mMilD4n88Bj-ntR35EZUMQ","Zm2rOksCSgNK_o0U1Vt-qQ"

"I've became a big fan of spray tanning since I decided to forgo laying out in the sun years ago. Unfortunately, I try not to use the Durango location due to poor customer service. Most times the Versa is out of spray or it has malfunctioned (tonight the heater is broken- not good, it's a very cold night). The BodyHeat on W. Charleston rocks!!

Unless they improve service, time, and over all cleanliness this place will be shuttered in no time.

She said she needed to call manager for approval to take it off the bill. 10 min later she let's us know that manager will NOT adjust bill.

Overall, this place is irrelevant, and came to the conclusion that my beef and broccoli is superior... Next!","2015-03-23","0","ujBk7cdEvo5FkD1e0Gzq1Q","d4XCDUWioKG1XxzSzCkbTA"

"Over this bank! I made a CASH deposit on a Friday, April 28 at 5:30 at the ATM (that scans the cash for you, no more envelopes) and called the following Wednesday to ask why I was charged an overdraft fee for one of my bills that hit my account on Wednesday. I was told my CASH deposit was not going to clear until may 9! So I was charged fees and they are holding my cash! Not acceptable - using the ATM is useless! Hate this bank!","2017-05-03","0","K76-9ITG_LITsWtyNSrDfg","PxwAVJ5M5n8Y6rwyGX_8EA"
"9\/20-our order taken at 6:16 on the receipt & at 6:53 I checked & order wasn't ready-He said there was at least 10 min left or more- so I told him we had to go- I was never offered a refund just given coupons, which didn't even cover what we paid-he was very rude and said ""what do you want me to do give you more or something?"" we were so mad we left SB at 7 & went w\/out dinner-there wasn't a clean table inside or outside.1 hr they expected us to wait!Our 1st time & we will never go back! 2 bad","2013-09-23","0","uGcC3CKAolcwfOTMjjoexQ","PxwAVJ5M5n8Y6rwyGX_8EA"

"Mixed feelings about this place. The staff in the front are the rudest girls I've ever encountered. They couldn't even help a lady with a disability and were so rude to her that I stepped in to offer my help. The doctors are ok, had my sons surgery here and it worked. But the process to make appts and to be seen are ridiculous. It's been a draining experience to get my boyfriend to be seen. Makes me want to find a new doctors office just for the bedside manner.","2016-10-17","0","V8jMtazujWAxCYBdenrjkA","iUKvnXS0Y1-rq7S9QsDZqw"

"Hmm....I am a bit hesitant on this first day but hope to see improvement on following the daily lesson plan.                             Update : there was a staffing issue seems to be resolved.  As for preschool it is not traditional and they do not have a daily lesson plan or use worksheets ,desks and things like that but my daughter has fun playing with the other kids. So we will continue to attend until it is our turn (on the waitlist ) for a traditional preschool. Nice staff, good daycare.","2014-08-28","0","zLtZ7YiTO97zflMFweCi0A","nI2gZyZReOun6PSPlq7iSw"

We just concluded what can only be called a trying experience eating there. The food didn't seem fresh but what really took the cake was that the staff had a huge  amount of apathy. From the missing greeting you usually get when you enter the door to the disinterest of taking orders, I can not find a suitable reason to support this establishment any further.","2016-05-29","1","f5sSn5cO4t6mF_mdnzKkyA","kmvcxCVGu1BjXrDftbjvOQ"

"My family and I were very excited to eat here. We pulled up and got out of our cars the first person we encountered was walking thru the parking lot screaming they were closed and waving his arms like to go away, maybe a sign with open hours on it would help instead of someone walking around yelling at customers. I was very offended and I do not intend on returning,I will definitely tell my friends\/family of our experience, & I don't recommend this place. So much for being courteous to customers","2013-10-13","0","CauQnqZ5eowyrr7oWF_p3Q","7XabuZ5FSc_u78SpyxLuHg"

"Hmmm, nice place, but as a past employee in a restaurant, 2 negative things...there was no hostess to seat people and the sign said, ""please wait to be seated"" (no one knew where she was). Then, there was a LOT of loud ""whooping"" in the back, which probably echoes, but when your hostess is no where to be found and there is a ""party"" going on in the back, it makes guests feel a little neglected.  We are on a time schedule in the airport and don't have time to listen to the staff party.","2013-11-27","0","azxeH9W14hzFnZyuOm8JdQ","qYxn0CS7ZfV-k1fm8e6J9g"

"BEWARE! !!!! While you are at the box office purchasing tickets or redeeming an voucher, a screen will ask you if you would like to buy a drink upstairs for 33% off the regular price of $15.00. This equals $10.00 with tax for one shot of liquor or a $ 6.00 beer. This is.a bait and switch because when you get upstairs the drink you want cost more $$$ then the ones in the very tiny print on your drink voucher.

"A great place to just enjoy a solid Vegas steakhouse experience. Don't try to rush, you'll ruin the experience. Short ribs are incredible, 10 oz filet is always cooked perfectly. This time had the lobster bisque (cannot recommend enough) and the mozzarella salad (would opt for something different next time). The shiitake mushrooms with thyme were delicious as was a very classic potato gratin. I like it when the potatoes are still the star so this is perfect to me.But the monkey bread was killer!","2014-02-01","0","xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w","l7E5dQmzqg_X_oUI8x_88g"

Don't give this place a negative review... You'll subject yourself to ad hominem attacks by the owner and sous chef. I gave a fair positive 4 star review, my wife differed...

"Connie and I went for a quick dinner. She ordered the Crazy Alfredo and I the Asiago Mac 'n Cheese. They were both excellent. I was afraid the blue cheese would be too overpowering but it was mild. It was creamy with a nice touch of crunch from toasted breadcrumbs. And although Connie doesn't eat jalapenos and they won't make substitutions on dishes, she of course didn't eat any, but they imparted a nice flavor and mild heat to her dish. So like Arnold Schwarzenegger, we will be back.","2014-01-20","0","FYRVCh_ctzqY1Yj_6hDk7A","6BG-geUq96Q5j_sbG0fqlQ"

"Beware of this place especially if you got the gel mani pedi from group on!! The nail tech had to redo my nails coz the first time the polish didn't stick. It looks like I did my nails at home myself. I was there for more than 2 hours already and I did not have time to ask her to redo it again the 3rd time. Why advertise if you're not gonna  make sure techs do a good job.

"Hmmmm, was excited to see this opened. But we haven't even sat down at our table yet and already not impressed. We put our name down for a table and she asked if we wanted inside or outside or first available.  I said we wanted outside. So while we're waiting we sit at the bar to order drinks. I asked for iced tea and they ask if I'd like regular ice tea or passion and I tell them regular. I've already sent my tea back 3 times because they keep bringing me passion instead of regular yay.","2015-04-11","0","0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw","bXsfN7onULUNd1-5W1U62Q"

"Terrible! Don't go here. I paid 50 bucks for pink and whites and they look like shit. Ray Charles could've done a better job. Steve did my nails and instead of soaking them off first he tried to cut off with toe nail clippers. Last time I checked a manicure was supposed to be relaxing. He cut me twice with the nail file and he made my nails look like a cheap hookers. The sides are longer than my actual nail and he wouldn't listen to anything I was telling him. I will never go back here ever.","2013-07-24","0","ltnr4KSq3xZmVAm-zr3_Pw","bXsfN7onULUNd1-5W1U62Q"

"Walked in .. There are 2 bankers , one of which is doing nothing . Other with a couple . 2 young girl tellers .. 
I was going in to open another account . I waited for someone while the 2 girls talked . The couple came and went . That Banker went to lunch I guess because he never returned ! While the other guy sat on his laptop and let us sit there . We got up to leave .. Not one word . They  must be doing exceptional and not in the need for new clients .","2016-01-13","0","QZoCTRj9WYiLFWt4OGNGmg","uNxXIIFzjHm5r62UTyVjrQ"

"When I moved here to Las Vegas, I was without an OB\/GYN. The first woman I went to see was a joke. Dr. Zeluff on the other hand, was incredibly welcoming.

I hope he doesn't retire anytime soon because finding another OB\/GYN like him would be nearly impossible.","2016-09-09","0","oyvp2Ss-JWuz-ybcSP96ew","0JIkLuVC8nqciO-ki_pApg"

"Amazing place. It is so hard to find an honest vet that cares for your four legged friends as they do here. The whole staff is amazing. Dr. Fujikawa took care of my very outgoing cat Ted and she was amazing. When I went back I tried to get her again but she was full and since I was pressed for time with my dog having a large abscess, Dr. Hayward took care of her instead and she was incredible. Leeloo found her new doctor and we will only be coming back here from now on. THANK YOU!","2016-08-28","0","1rxumiF6MypngptYBPA01Q","W8JJGXuBqhdmQoSDoB7Wqg"

"Well one of Americas greatest places must be on the decline in Vegas.  The management here is the worst that I've ever experienced and I've worked with Morton's on many occasions and spent a tremendous amount of monies both personal and corporate funds.  I would not recommend the Vegas location-Maestro's on the strip offers a better atmosphere and much better service.","2013-05-18","0","sB1lPLICz4nrOuuqgLv50A","vLgDCeylsgleSpa3YtWmhw"

"Well I was hopeful that with new competition the ownership would step up and provide better service.  The place is backed up the staff is not well trained and people appear to be frustrated with how quickly the food is coming out of the kitchen.

They have very poor customer service and seem to be very unorganized.

"Went there and got a rear wheel bearing replaced. Cost me $540. The exact wheel bearing lasted only 17 months since I had it fixed. Went back and they said my warranty is over and it's gonna cost me $540 again. Since when does a wheel bearing last only 17 months? My car is a 2006 and all the rest of the wheel bearings is in good shape since I bought the car. I don't know if it's cheap parts or labor wasn't quality. Live and learn.

"This is by far the worst Chinese restaurant in Vegas. Don't expect to go there with more than 10 people and sit together. Their service is terrible and the waiters are no better. When asked a simple question that they don't like they will throw an attitude and slam the teas on the table. And as we got up and left they had the audacity to clap. The food is average and there are better restaurants with better food at the strip. We have also found a bug in One of our dim sum dishes as well.","2013-05-22","0","vtkJXE_Vdz27rWm6mfAw6Q","hQI_1esMmxh2o-ocVHYMCw"

Update, nice lady came by with my meal and offered a refund.  Her genuine concern and my belief you should pay what you owe were more than enough to understand the mistake. I refused the refund.Will return.","2013-05-08","0","6bgjcFOy4WHMyw62_1V9Pw","DEH2FRyh7cKwv2xFHM6AtQ"

"My wife and I decided to go with Carriage Inn for our caterer for our wedding on October12, 2013. We had 200 guests. We were nervous because we read some negative reviews online, but the price was very reasonable. The food was excellent! We couldnt have been happier with the food and the service was great! Thats all every1 talked about besides the wedding being so nice was that the food was great and who was the caterer! 5 stars on food and service! We wont recommend any other caterer after this","2014-02-07","0","KNpcPGqDORDdvtekXd348w","EO-Z4lFBl4cGaXY-kDWmJA"

The bread is always stale plus our waitress embarrassingly told us you got to pay for extra bread if you order the pasta.Who in Pittsburgh charges extra for bread. Travelling from Clairton isn't worth the drive. I'll go to Ciccanti's or Hill's in New Eagle. They serve fresh bread with no extra charge.

"This tiny place makes the best cakes in town.  I  had never been there before I was looking for a place to do my wedding cake.  Their standard icing is delicious  and their fillings -  just try the coconut or raspberry almond, OMG!!  Did I mention the blackberry? I loved all 3  so I got each one in a different layer.   They even made an original design  for my cake,  which was a beach theme.   There is a picture of it behind the register in their store. Everyone I have sent here  loves it!","2013-03-16","0","SLc54id9GKnHXaT_07WbFg","N5_Dyq6VKqoPnBs0FbUDqA"

"Currently serving a seasonal ""Candy Roaster Pie"". A candy roaster is a squash indigenous to the south. The restaurant flew up seeds and grew them here in Quebec. 

Also, try subbing dark rum for bourbon in the Kentucky Mule making it a ""dark & stormy"" made with their house ginger beer and bitters! 
It's incredible!

Ambiance sitting outside was pretty nice, service was pretty slow\/bordering on inattentive, food-while portions were small it was overall  pretty tasty.

"Lets just begin by saying this is THE ORIGINAL polish deli in pittsburgh! 25 years I think miss Anna told me they have been in business and still going strong! Alfred's isn't the largest store in the neighborhood but it is definitely QUALITY polish food. What others claim to be ""the best"" around the city is hardly the case.. She sells the most authentic kielbasa you can get! It's seriously amazing..If you want plain jane kielbasa then I suggest shop and save. Canned goods, pierogi, etc!

"These owners need to take a moment and seriously review some of these comments. Some are obviously insane and those people can never be pleased but, others need paid attention to.
I called to have new tires put on my SUV, my tires that i purchased online. They wanted 36$ per tire to mount and balance, thats 145 bucks. 45 dollars more than my Audi dealer and they use Hunter equipment and I get coffee, donuts, wifi and a real appreciation of my business there.
