"My girlfriend and I stopped in January 1, 2014 for an evening meal.  She gets the trio off of happy menu and it arrives COLD!!!!!!!
We send it back and we are not complainers because she works in industry.
We wait awhile and she gets 2nd try and that is cold. We were sitting at bar.
We ask for manager and  or nephew of owner finally stops by and did not listen to a word my girlfriend had to say...
All he could say was she tried some of the food so he WOULD NOT comp meal.

"Wish I saw this review before I sent them my hard earned money. Long story short. Saw a coin online I needed for my collection. Ordered it and paid with US Postal money order. No coin sent after empty promises and they refuse to send back a refund. Ehsan told me that their supplier stiffed them after stalling me so long so be careful in advance. They don't have in inventory what they post as available online and once they have your money, it's gone. Buyer beware!","2013-06-27","0","YSIK0E1E2GZ7jIls_v8aSw","OBwF-J0RYip9o4ZI7DPLTg"

"Let me start off my saying I love pink spot. Up intell today I have had nothing but great experiences. I was having an issue with my battery so I took it in. Come to find out it was something I could have fixed at home. But the young lady who helped me make me feel so stupid for not knowing this. She was also rude when I was trying to choose a new flavor. I know you are all the experts but you should not be making us newbies feel stupid. Very disappointing.","2014-03-12","0","fYSsuT30m6lR_OzVjUGz_g","9pLC8tXeWIsZRYm_33WfUQ"

By far the best juice I've had the honor to vape. I look forward to my return and the new drip bar. Couldn't get the full flavor from your tanks but juice was WAY better when I got my bottle. I can not thank you enough for the experience. I would like to see a glass bottle option but not complaining. Thanks again","2014-04-28","0","8UyT00RWePMYO5ZFQXGlqg","Bw7u2L6VAPPpoXCTaxr_kQ"

I requested my condiments on the side. When my meal arrived the blackberry jam described in the menu was nothing more than a single serving of Smuckers grape jelly. Really???

It was like walking on fly paper and when I tried to move my feet I had to put some serious effort behind it.  The bathrooms were less than stellar as well with floors that had NOT been mopped and counters that were a true ICKK factor.

"I guess I was spoiled with gramma T's homemade food back home. I just found the catfish here at soul food cafe was bland. Not seasoned enough. Potatoe salad was too relishy. Tasted boxed, with a little touch up. And the greens were too plain. Great flavor, but needed some hammocks. The cornbread was great. Yams were good, just needed to be a little darker and stickier. 
Coming back of course to try ribs.

"One Tip - NEVER GO TO THIS TERRIBLE PLACE. FOOD IS HORRIBLE (Frozen then de-frosted taste and smell), SERVICE IS EVEN WORSE. NO JAPANESE CHEF AT THIS JAPANESE NOODLE SHOP! ANYONE can look into their Open Kitchen and see there are only 4 Hispanic Cooks in the kitchen and that is it. No wonder their Japanese dishes tastes ABSOLUTELY NOT Japanese! The waitresses all speaks and acts as everyone in the world owes them money.

"A bit overpriced for the portions...but nevertheless food is good. Service not all that great. They're really nice but trying too hard.  Might be under staffed. Took forever to get a hold of my waiter. I wasn't sure whose my waiter whose the helper and whose the person who checks in to see how ""everything"" is. Menu is very appealing. I will try coming back to give another try...hope they can redeem themselves with better service. BTW writing this review while waiting about 25 min for my check","2014-08-26","0","IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng","ErPkdHwkpIWNo75W0Y97QA"

"Jude did an amazing cut and color on my hair today. I had about 5-6 inches cut off into an updated asymmetrical layered bob. It is absolutely beautiful. And she added some partial highlights to warm it up and give it some depth. Best cut and style I've had in ages and her prices are very reasonable for the quality of work!

"Got introduced to boba by a friend a few years ago and ever since then I've loved it. I've tried a few boba places in Vegas but this place stands out in my opinion. Mostly the menu, so many option\/flavors to choose from. I think this place has the best boba and the owner is very helpful and kind. If you love boba like me, I say give this place a try, not only boba but lots of sweets to choose from as well","2015-08-08","0","IBKNR0-FL_Y5KzXqA1yS4A","5u4wbm3C518Rtob3Zcqf3w"

"The place is hiding, you need to make a trip to find it. But when you get there all your trip effort is NOT WORTH IT. The service is very very bad as if they don't want you to go there. And when placing an order its better to for you to write it down Coz no matter how many times you repeat it they have a hard time understanding you. And as a result you'll get a wrong order and when. You tell them they will never apologize and instead get Mad at you. Management pls check on your people.","2016-04-14","0","IBKNR0-FL_Y5KzXqA1yS4A","rf4Nq_2WnLhsUDNCEtTqbA"

"Another success story today thanks to Bob. Last year our yellow lab Honey jumped up and knocked over a three year old boy. Today while taking a walk with two yellow labs we were surrounded by 4 children ages 3 to 6 and both Rocky and Honey sat there on command and let the children pet, talk and walk around them. It was the best distraction test yet and the dogs passed with amazing results. Thank you Bob so much as we now have well-behaved dogs in public after 3 lessons.","2016-03-20","0","7VfktTKK-ixMGdS2K71Urw","Il8MN95AbJQhdpvTOCGrYw"

I would definitely come back. So often burger places over cook the meat, but not in this case. Reading the menu was entertaining in itself.

When you travel 120 days a year, and you're only halfway through an 8 day trip, and you're tired and smelly from rushing to the airport after you've overslept, and you really don't want Starbucks coffee, you will want to go to Cartel. The staff is knowledgable & friendly. Compared to other Cartels, you will find good coffee. Compared to other options in the PHX airport, you will find the best cup of coffee you you've ever had.

The side door was open though (this was around 12:15pm, no noticed before then?). Ordered honey BBQ wings and a cheesesteak. The cheesesteak tasted like hamburger & cheese whiz, the wings had definite freezer burn, we threw away more than half.

"Never go to JaBistro again. This is what I ordered tonight and I usually don't like raw stuff so I specifically asked waitress to recommend any cooked food for me. They told me the sushi is well-done. However, I suffered my first Food Poisoning experience after eating. 30 mins finishing this meal, I started to get a big headache and a little dizzy while walking outside. Later, I went back home and suffered serious diarrhea and vomited 4 times throughout the night.","2017-12-04","0","Qmwfg-PtYuCo5Q_IwcA_HQ","7SYRrkP8v8Pz_lGYuaTgNA"

"If you park in the covered garage on a weekday, you can get your parking ticket validated for the first hour so you'll usually won't have to pay anything out of pocket. If you park on the weekend, however, the city raises the parking fees by a few cents. So after having MTO validate your parking ticket, you'll end up paying 75 cents out of pocket for the first hour on a weekend. You can also try to find street parking as well.","2014-06-02","0","ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg","4QmQi3dNNVBRoclybsHACw"

"Eating guide:
Step 1: pick the soup. Note that with each soup, it comes with assorted side dish for the soup and some meat as well. You don't need extra meat if you are not feeling the meat.

Step 2: once the soup arrive (caution, soup is HOT), immediately put the necessary topping into the soup to cook it.

Step 3: eat the noodle, again, the bowl holding the soup is hot. You have 2 choices, eat straight from the bowl or take it out and eat the noodle from a seperate bowl.","2017-08-25","0","aR0dWZeGyDjVpgJfBqYdpQ","5hbSXejhP-5b1cSe8XwJDw"

"I happened upon Envy Nails on Thanksgiving Day when my mom was in town visiting. From the minute we walked in the door,  my mom and I were welcomed by Andy and his wife. We were treated like guests in their home. I received the best pedicure I have had. Not only was it the best massage but also included warm lotion and hot rocks to follow it up. The entire experience was so relaxing and perfect. I have gone there ever since and would not go anywhere else. It is worth every penny.","2013-04-21","0","fKPVcdtvnyoGiGMrR9aoVw","iA3jlKKLC_I33d2RPJKr9w"

"Wow! I really enjoyed my trip to the salon today. As usual, my hands and feet look and feel GREAT, but as a nice little pre-holiday relaxation fun, I was witness to some HYSTERICAL friendly banter between Andy and a couple of his technicians. It was like a front-row seat to my own personal comedy show. What a nice way to unwind before the bustling of Christmas!!","2013-12-23","1","fKPVcdtvnyoGiGMrR9aoVw","4oYEAJz9_eg3Y8TiJZLc2g"
"Well I was satisfied with them but not this visit. :( I called in the morning to make a appt with specific techs. One of them tried to get off with doing my guests pedicure but I reminded him that the appt was made for him so he did it. I made an appt with Andy but he sent another tech to do my pedicure while he did another woman's nails. The 'new' tech cut me and made me bleed. I NEVER bled before. And she did my pedi real fast. After a stressful day at work this is NOT what I expected :(","2013-07-10","0","fKPVcdtvnyoGiGMrR9aoVw","7I0sq0Qx1bhd7-NwwXYuEQ"

"I was not impressed with the customer service interaction during my first visit to Brandy Melville. All I wanted to know was whether the stock  and price was same across Canada. The sales lady not only looked at me as if I was stupid, but she talked to me as if I was. She looked fed up and irritated that I was asking her a question or two. I don't think I'll go back if my first impression of the store was curt, unfriendly and condescending.","2016-03-11","0","cx-eQP9HDe8mjzK_ML4gkA","7PS041GLJ_k7bWQKu9_Cjg"

We took the 2hr tour & were covered in dust from head to toe at the end (you have so much fun that you don't even realize you are in the dust)!

Several beer and food stations where you can run a tab and it applies to all (so you don't have to keep going to the same spot). Good selection of beer. You can get food from the food truck or a full meal from inside. Lots of room to roam.

The reservation guy so rude n start screaming and swearing. In the ends JJ the server guy always awesome as ever. The bill came of $107. We were a bit tipsy so they decided to scam us by charging $121 instead. Check the bill twice and never order those orders..

Well, because the food was cold, was sitting pre made, microwaved and sent out. I kid you not, the beef skewers were warm outside and COLD inside.. Same with salmon croquettes, the shrimps too. Fried calamari was probably killed alive in salt cuz, thats how salty it was. Cherry on top, the waiter had terrible BO!","2013-07-21","0","10RFV-vuQ52VUkmzFXbWaA","rgiG41eduynCPPqGywgj8g"

We got sat at a dirty table that was never cleaned until our food came (despite the fact we asked three times). When the waitress cleared out table, she spilt a glass of water on my lap. She offered to buy me a beer ( which she never did) after the water was on my pants and phone. 

It took over an hour for our food. Our check had drinks on it that we never ordered.  If it's during a busy event or a Pirates game, don't even bother.","2013-09-27","0","TYZIMuHwhZo_Hizenmf8Pg","_WZOZE2kAZre4hN_yzojaQ"

Well, all they are Learning is to drink excessively, make a mess of the surrounding neighborhoods and disrupting the surrounding Tempe residents by throwing glass bottles from their balconies onto other property and their matienence crew doesn't give a shit about it either.

I always get gel nails and I've had some horrible experiences elsewhere until I found this place after getting a tip. I only like getting them done by denny (although everyone is pretty good there) but denny gets them really thin and smooth, which can be hard for gel nails.

They do blood work and you have to call constantly just to get a response on labs or elevate the matter. Then when they do call back, they have to tell you IN-PERSON what's going on. They're not worth the trouble or frustration. Find another doctor and practice is my advice.","2015-03-01","0","1NJPR31R-LNvDTcY_NaPmQ","JnS_9P4To2scne5z4ky5sg"

"Fabulous food service was wonderful. Menu is creative and fun with a Southern flair. The shrimp and grits had great flavor and the sauce was just spicy enough. Cocktails and other alcohol are trendy and really good. This chain is expanding would like one in Fort Worth, tx.

I have gotten take out that was cold & just YUCK  in general I think the food is hit & miss...and expensive for the portion size. For example I got the beef stroganoff Inside dinning... I loved it ! Then I ordered it to go & it was cold ..dry & horrible. I did let them know the next time I came in & they did apologize and it was much better.","2016-02-20","0","QwAJZuJTo36OAj6DJxz14g","9VFAt1aOXB2cPWLdJm_sLg"

The honey jalape√±o that came with the sweet fries and the aioli and the ketchup that came with the truffle fries are very good.

I'd give them 5 stars on the shakes. 3-4 on the fries and 3-4 on the burgers. That being said, my standards are fairly high and overall, not bad, but not great.","2013-04-08","0","cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g","pzSpERslswEEF23OWSTBVQ"

"The chicken burger was very good - the highlight of the meal. Fries were a little too rich (truffle oil and parm?). Farm burger was cooked well and the duck bacon was tasty; however, they committed a cardinal sin: overcooking the fried egg. The yoke was nearly solid when it should have been very runny. Overall an okay meal but nothing to suggest that burgers are their specialty.","2013-05-27","0","cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g","slvOBlJPuycV9Mn2VS17Nw"

"I must say Bobby and the guys at AA Auto rock! They are fair and believe in taking care of the customer. I purchased an 04 navigator, realized the alternator was bad after a dealer diagnosis. I took my vehicle over to aa auto and they fixed it for much less than the dealership price. I really trust these guys with all my vehicles. They serviced my truck fast and efficiently and with a smile. This shop oozes integrity.  Do your vehicle or a favor and take it to see them. You won't be sorry.","2014-09-01","0","7xkk4Kq9pVXs1TP00Qv6fQ","fzG8scXsOLSsychuL6CkjQ"

"So on this taco Tuesday trip to backyard taco, the register didnt honor taco tuesday! Nooooooo!  So I paid full price for 6 tacos. All good, I called when I got home and they made it right. I have nothing bad to say about this spot.  Now I have a reason to go back before next tuesday!  See taco Tuesday starts at 2pm and its 2:08pm when I ordered (see pic)  Not sure why it didnt honor the deal but like i said, they fixed it and were very polite about it. Great job BYT!","2017-10-10","0","e4NQLZynhSmvwl38hC4m-A","9PY47nJL62nTb0TSUvKhfQ"

"This place at first looked like a good place to have authentic Korean food.  
We were far from it.  Banchan was a small plate of kimchi that we had to cut ourselves and a really small plate of pickled radish.  Wow!  That was it.  Then we waited almost 40 minutes for the main course.  Every time we asked for something else like refilling our tea or a bowl of rice (which they charge extra when ordering any stew!) it took almost ten minutes.  To say the least we will never come back.","2013-05-14","0","04HfzvvANCF3hd-yx6ZACw","c7vShA9u-mYgcjVEQYFhIQ"

In the eight years we have lived here in Henderson there has been no local Chicago style food that lives up to the reputation of the Windy City food. The quality and way they prepare the hot dogs is as good as you can get in Chicago.  The Italian beef is awesome too.

"I have to agree with some of the other reviews, the food isn't bad, but it's way overpriced for Italian food. There are places to go, where I would have received double or triple the amount of food, and paid half of what I paid last night. I live in Ballantyne and went there just because I didn't want to drive elsewhere...","2017-11-06","0","tIiiq23utFKTs1At2bVD6w","zhH7ail5uzNZjJZMITwqJg"

"Burgers were really good.  You should be pretty hungry to have the regular burgers- the ""little"" (slightly less than 1\/4 lb) are enough otherwise.
Fries were tasty too, but I think they gave us one PEI field's worth of potatoes for a ""little"" and a ""regular"". Can't imagine how much we would have received for a ""large"".

"This is THE ABSOLUTE WORST Shoeless Joes location. STAY AWAY! The service is absolutely horrible! And the food as well! Went with a group of people we all ordered wings with sauce on them, the sauce was drizzled on, there was barely anything on them! And the wings were so dry as well! If we wanted plain wings we would have asked for that instead! Service is horrible and so are wait times...went there 2 years ago, decided never to go back, but we did and nothing has changed. STAY AWAY!","2014-11-09","0","AJVS93SEUPzn63m2ogYNwQ","DeaxfuQxYdBNXvy2kfSI-g"

Anyways i had cut and wash with Jeffrey.
I wasn't specific since I didn't really have any style in mind but only the length i want.

He did a good job. Place was neat. Got offered tea but they got set up before i could get a chance to drink it lolz :) and the massage was great too. 
I love my new look. :))

"Super disappointed! Walked in there looking to buy a new flavor. The nice taller man with a Mohawk up sold us into two new flavors, a new battery, & a tank. He was AWESOME! He ten explained it would be more beneficial to me to just get a new starter kit as it comes with 1 free flavor included and would save me just a little bit of money. Who's not down to save just a bit of money these days? So my husband and I picked my new pink battery, pink tank, a flavor.","2013-07-21","0","gS4ZzhSjdEEFj-lLUbIxWg","cvAOBUm7f8cNgOMvl2JZfQ"

"We sat at the bar and our waiter Rob W. was very informative, knowledgable and he never took long to get anything we needed. He also kept us updated if the dish would take a little longer (which i love). We got the 6 corse favorites, which the chef chooses. Hot plates, hamachi Kama was so good we ordered another round. For chicken, the Karaage was delicious but then again everything was very good. The pricing: for what you get was very reasonable and fair.
We will definalty return.","2013-08-10","0","364hhL5st0LV16UcBHRJ3A","Nn8Oz4HdDAkNeKFiKuk1cw"

"I left a review a while ago on how great the Caesar Salad was here.i have been back several times and it was consistently good. Stopped in today to find out they have made changes to the menu. This includes no longer mixing the dressing into the salad. This changes the taste dramatically The exception dressing is too thick to adequately mix in at the table.     I did appreciate the discussion I had with the Manager about this. He was very open and promised to take it up with corporate.","2017-12-06","0","0Cqkgz8hz8sLYvSkZhBDzQ","9mOnPgqNk1S-kUN0JKi0sw"

"I'm from hawaii where there are Acai bars everywhere! This place, BY FAR, has the worst acai bowls I've ever had. It's like, slush. It's not thick and creamy like I've always had. I don't mind that it's not sweet; because that's what the agave is for. But it was like they blended 1 acai smoothie pack with a bucket of ice. I just don't understand how it came out this way. I also don't understand how they have rave reviews about their bowls. It was DEFINITELY not great. =\","2014-07-22","0","XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw","nl2o0kovLXXU1faZ9H-xYg"

"Don't let the name fool you...their menu is for little pansy girls that take a bite of eggs and get full for $10.95. No big breakfast at all, no combo with tons of food to get you through day; might as well be ala carte menu. Pass.

"Every time that my husband and I make an appointment to see him, it takes about 45 minutes for the PA to take us in the room. Then it takes another 10-20 minutes for the doctor to come in and see you. The funny thing is when he comes in the room, he does not spend more than 2 minutes with you and rushes out Something doesn't add up in this office. If he spend only 2 minutes with each patient , i don't understand why it takes him so long to come and see the patient","2015-05-29","0","u4TDplSvOi-3NEmkWHbRRQ","WrLdn-QRZu81I8vxA4gX0A"

After the drinks came we order several things, we only received half of our initial order. While we were grilling our meat the lady came over and started cutting the meat with what looked to be already used scissors.Do not recommend this place to anyone. You'll leave smelling like BBQ smoke since they have no exhaust fans in this facility.","2017-04-01","0","IsyO4wTJWY9dy-Iq0l1EiA","PoHrw3iX8f_118M9sWbubQ"

"If you are buying a new kit I suggest finding three or four more flavors you love. Because the kit is 80 dollars. Comes with a case. Charger(under an essentially lifetime warranty). Two batteries(under an essentially lifetime warranty). Four clearomizers (tank that holds your juice and produces vapor). And a bottle of juice. If you get three more bottles of juices that equals to a grand total of $105, you get an extra bottle free of charge. Putting you at five bottles of juices.

"Service was poor, and waitress had an attitude.  Home fries were soggy as well as my wife's hash browns. I had the corned beef hash, which was mediocre at best, however my wife did enjoy her omelette. Save yourself the heartache and just go to an IHOP or Denny's, the food will be better and most likely will the service. I sincerely wanted this to be my new b-fast spot. It just doesn't cut the mustard. If the food appeared as pictured it might be a different story.","2013-06-16","0","J8GuDrqeLH1xMpSpeEixYA","Xj3RFGgzu0PW9P3CXs-rqg"

Not only do they provide an abundant serving, but the food is fresh and extraordinary. We ended the meal with a beignet tree loaded with soft, warm, delicious beignets and a plate of warm mini chocolate chip cookies that melt in your mouth.

"I wish I could agree with the majority here.. I was very unimpressed with this restaurant.  The service was excellent but the food extremely average at best.  

The meatball was below average.  The texture more chewy than delicate. The pasta served before the entree tasted like Chef Boyrdee.  My filet was over cooked and lacked flavor.  Maybe I expected too much. The Outback on The Strip would have been a better choice.  IMHO","2013-10-02","0","z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ","bxBiYX_2GObgek3sGnPhSA"

"I had the Nom Nom, fries and a soda and paid $15.65.  The crinkle fries were good, and the Kobe beef dog had good flavor, but what really disappointed me was the standard out of the package bun, complete with hard dry ends. This completely ruined my meal.  A gourmet bun and\/or a steamer would be a huge improvement.  For the money, try pinks down the street. ( they don't steam their buns either) but the dogs have a great ""snap"" when you bight into them. ( which stood out, and I will go back for)","2014-02-13","0","VbEK6-etnKKaPamrG2jWjQ","NNdgEpDdSwubIEdWwUPEVA"

"If you buy a groupon for 30 days of free tanning, do not leave a credit card on file because if you forget to call and cancel your account you will be responsible for each month after. Then you might get some incorrect information from the tanning salon manager who screwed up and instead of taking responsibility for his error, is insisting you pay anyway even of you haven't been there in a while.

"By far the best realtor service in Phoenix!  I've worked with many realtors over the years, and there's no competition w\/ Jason McNeal at Zoomie Brokers.
A few years ago I had the idea of picking up rental properties, but my main concern was finding a trustworthy realtor who could guide me through all aspects of the investment, including purchase, property rehab & placing tenants.  Jason provided AMAZING service.  3 properties later, I've yet to be disappointed.  I highly recommend him!!!","2013-02-21","0","LsvCEHopMzm4N7a6lgyc-Q","tWkB5-nLU0jGvBP-ahi_8g"

"Not the best ""sports bar"" the decor was extremely minimal which did not give off a good bar atmosphere. The tables were left behind from the Italian resturant that was there before which again did not give off a bar feel. There also must be a sewage problem in the building because the smell was almost unbareable. The Owners were very personable so that was an up side. Overall I think they could really step up their game.","2013-03-11","0","WWdPXSNLduMNK-ybk9HcuA","Xp-jpL80hIgFHLijbcmhJw"

"Only been here twice for Sunday brunch. Both times our servers\/food was DELICIOUS but the seating situation was a cluster f@ck. There's two entrances but only one hostess stand and no room to stand there waiting without hovering over nearby tables. Went with a group of 8 for one visit and they held a large table for a group who wasn't  there, even though they don't take reservations. So we stood next to an empty table for 20 minutes...very annoying. But brunch menu is awesome!!","2016-04-17","0","LNsZJP6jZ11e0tDljOLPiQ","xl8aH5Z52J4mtZzvIiiEow"

"No appointment needed which is nice but it is pretty pricey.  Both the girl who did my nails and the one at the register were very friendly.  Love the lotion\/exfoliant!

UPDATE: I did gel on both fingers and toes and my nails lasted about the same amount of time they would've if I'd gotten a gel mani at home but this was my first time doing gel on my toes and aside from my natural nail growth the polish lasted nearly a month!

"We didn't expect to be so disappointed. There was no bartender at all during their ""happy hour"" was odd, our waitress had to make us our drinks which took her 20 minutes. Our server had absolutely no knowledge of the menu. One of our group members ordered an appetizers as his meal- they were out but we weren't informed until half way through the meal. The server would disappear and not refill drinks. I would rather do take out then sit in there again. The only good thing was the sushi itself.","2013-06-30","0","RZFryvOkznd4jtpj8PbSzg","8sCq08d2BPMJRTOaoLE-lw"

"The dull white guy that took our order (happens to be the owner apparently) was undeniably rude the way he took our orders because my 3 year old son wanted his attention to order something. Next he tells us not to ring the small bell ever again (ever heard of saying pls?) and then he pretty much made two of our Chai extra light instead of extra strong!

"Remember when you found a secret tomb in Oblivion? Or that tough to find fairy for a heart piece in Zelda? That last treasure in Uncharted, skull in Halo, Rourke file in Call of Duty?

That's what it feels like when you visit Iceman. It's a diamond in the rough, the ultimate Mom and Pop game store with a dreamy mix of old classics and new games. It's hard to believe more people don't know about the store, as it far surpasses both the big retailers and the other small shops in TO.

The Bulalo was so well done I wanted to ask for a second serving. The lechon paksiw was phonomenal and the lechon belly was amazing. Alex who is running the front is just the friendliest guy around.

"Completely different from the first location. Chairs were too high, too hard and the tables too far and too low. You couldn't move either of them. Nearby tables had not been cleaned. It was as hot inside as it was outside. 4 different menu items were not available. The server gave me a stained little cup that was obviously just washed since it was wet. Reminds me of the carenderias in Cebu. I don't mind carenderias but if I'm paying $$ for this place, I expect more.

"Tip 1: Don't go here. EPIC FAIL on Amy & Mark(?) - the owners - do shady business. They don't honor the ""pay with cash and earn points towards a service."" 

Tip 2: If you choose to still go, don't voice a concern over the ""workmanship"" from their employees. You will be made to feel like it's your fault and feel inferior on future visits.

Tip 3: DO NOT GO. There are hundreds of other nail shops that do better work and  appreciate your business.","2015-04-09","0","mO8ukT3f5BRQ29pC_WoAtg","cRB1iYjUr7rPRGDdmhqkeA"

"If you order breakfast burritos -- which are HUGE; best food value around -- after traditional breakfast hours (I usually go just before midnight), make sure they understand what you ordered.

Also best calamari ever with large, thick, succulent strips. Friendly service. Perfect dinner to top off our vacation to California.

"What a fun place!!! Service was excellent - Eddie was very personable and made great suggestions for our first visit there. He also checked in several times with helpful hints on getting the fish taco successfully in our mouths rather than slipping out the back end. 

Great videos playing on the flat screen of surfing and water fun history in Maui. The decor also makes you feel like you are in a super stylie beach cafe on the island.

"I wish the Olive Garden would check up on their waitresses. As for we tried all sorts of Olive Gardens around town. And this is by far the worst. We had this hostess get our order and she didn't even write it down. Said that she is Amanda; looked like she belonged in college. Plus she reeked of smoke got our whole order wrong. Finally after spending forever in there we got what we needed thanks to another waiter. 
  Amanda should be in the back with the dishes or maybe that's too hard for her?","2015-11-18","0","XdOxflXrlWRdL9IWzXC54Q","3nQzRKzD9z03s7YgHnopbA"

"I went in with very high expectations: the atmosphere was great. I purchased a mani-pedi for $35. The pedicure was super rushed. Lukewarm water, a hack job cuticle cutting that left me with an INFECTION in my big toe, and a really poor paint job, and all within the span of 10 minutes. I went over to the nail bar to get my hands done, and they were done within 6 minutes. They didn't seal the edges, the paint coats were uneven. And my manicure chipped within 2 days.

"Forgot to take pics but loved the place. Long waiting time but nice service. A chef was at the front desk by chance and then started talking to me and my friend. Then he offered a free Lamb Burger if we order another burger. So yeah we ordered the original one and got the Lamb burger which is absolutely delicious! It was quite a big portion for girls so make sure don't order too much ;)","2014-07-01","0","_vZ7bHaGCjllogiZ7RH17w","MzS1b-e-_mrCaVrXQHVTTw"

"My husband and i were Teharu fans until we found this place - Excited to have a sushi place closer to home! Some of the other negative reviews make this place sound scary, but after eating here we disagree - this place is awesome! Hip, clean, good food choices (that support gluten free eating!!), and cheap. They have 1$ - 3$ plates and the portion sizes are good.The only negative thing is that beer is more expensive here then at Teharu - it's 6$. Otherwise we recommend Ahi!! :)","2013-09-22","0","d7ozMWbBwcFOkHM3zmktfA","eYLZXq8_CkaEFtwta2zwHg"

"You know it's a shithole when one of the stakeholders hit on you, and when you and your buddies turn him down, you coincidentally get pulled aside by a bouncer, your beers forcibly  removed from you, and then you are asked to leave. I say he is a stakeholder, but if he is not, then it is in Sip's best interest to disown this creep's ass, and go about their business. If he is in fact apart of the business, then I award them no points, and may God have mercy on their souls...","2015-03-14","0","yZwuB_xo-N843Nx5sRP1QQ","TM9Ngh3dFWIZyJyr2zJXog"

Make sure you read the reviews on Angie's list too! Similar experiences where Kyle blames the customer and makes excuses or should I say ""creates facts"" so he can state his company is not responsible for damages done by his ""fast"" crew. Also shady at how they rush you to sign their contract! Again buyer beware!!!!","2016-06-06","0","--qvQS4MigHPykD2GV0-zw","jgFLMfA5pffqr53emybR3A"

This place is so underrated! The service is quick! I had a new server and the manager heather checked on me 4 times to make sure I was satisfied and not upset! Either that server is a quick learner or they really trained her well!

"I agree with the comment on the office help. Dr Mendoza is probably one of the best pediatricians here in the valley. I am even willing to forgo the LONG wait times. The only downfall is the lack of compassion of the girls at the desk. They have zero personality, are very abrupt and have no sense of professionalism. If I were in charge of the front office I would have fired them a long time ago and I have been going to Dr Menidiza for 6 years!","2014-07-23","0","X8HiYTzDMoErnhVbCqBWCw","MhXqf8WkqOXu8KOC45cmBQ"

"Excellent variety that you don't normally get at other AYCE sushi. Also, they have all you can drink beer & sake. Friendly waitress, although I think they were thought my party was going to clean them out with food. Small & cozy","2014-06-24","0","PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw","1B-y0vJqZCDbyNjVgK6lFQ"

They were able to take me right away after my cleaning so I could get everything filled without waiting for another appointment. 
It's been a little over two weeks since being there and overall my teeth are great.","2015-05-12","0","Hje78gWdXHjiLjtxQLjurA","vwWzhRVK0X2oslxhu3cWXQ"

I had ordered a sectional in November '13 it is April '14 now it was supposed to be delivered in a week from the warehouse. They told me it was there but when it came time for delivery they never had one.

"Never really a big fan of spray tans but my friend recommended Dina when I complimented her tan. I'm a total believer now. I got non stop compliments and her coming to my house to spray was the best thing ever! She's a total perfectionist and won't leave until your tan looks perfect (and that only takes her about 5 minutes!) no booth where you're suffocating and breathing in tanning spray, just super cute and trendy Dina making you look fabulous!","2013-04-26","0","u53gz-HlTfMoSSlMJlpPEg","UQBBrEz-Wm40R7a1tBVf7Q"

She showed up with her tent and product, set me up, made me feel very comfortable, and made it look so easy. I got a light tan, two layers. I was nervous because when I was spray tanned 4 years ago it was extremely streaky and got on every bra and piece of clothing. Not AT ALL the case with Brushed By Dina.

"I saw Jessica for the first time to have a few moles removed about a year ago. Although the moles were small, they were in a spot where I knew of their existence on a daily basis.

I just recently got married and will be bringing my husband to her for a mole removal.","2015-11-05","0","ti7UmThnMV34Juvib64FhA","PCRZf2kYjnQ2cqpeoKiROA"

Incredible scents so the spray tan doesn't smell, shimmer to give it a flawless glow, and the powder to keep it from being sticky are the little things that make this the best place to go. Not only do you get all of the extra little things, but the price is perfect: $40. Seriously can't get any better than this.","2013-09-25","0","WQ1TU9rxjvY8oAgMaE5FwA","re0dReR4i7XFNC3zX5VwJQ"

"Great food and great beer. Nachos were among the best ever tasted. Perfect blend of spice and a touch of sweet. 1842 burger was amazing; caramelized onions, saut√©ed mushrooms and truffle aioli were the perfect combo. Others had delicious fish and chips; very fresh with a light batter - literally melted in your mouth. Chef Michael Mina happened to be in the restaurant and was incredibly friendly and generous with his time.

"Most amazing spa; excellent prices; superior customer service.  The spa owner personally greeted us, accommodated 6 massages with less than 24 hour notice, provided tea and water and a free gift.  My massage therapist, Armando, is well practiced in different types of therapy and addressed many physical and stress ailments.

"Needed some new tires, ok goodyear and while  there at it new brake pads and a oil change . Pick up car cool drive to work this morning oil running out of car . Go to different goodyear shop someone forgot to put a gasket on oil filter. They corrected the problem. Be careful, While waiting I called the district manager SHANE perfect for the position ( he was great at playing dumb ) he should move up the ranks soon.

"I come here all the time and I just want to say I love the food! The service is always fantastic. I'm a picky eater with specific orders. I always come around the same time and I usually see the  same cooks back there. There is one in particular, I don't know his name but he wears a hat and has tattoos but he always makes my food perfect and has the best attitude with a smile always on his face. Keep up the good work skinny fats!","2013-12-22","0","3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ","19XTpjwKeHb_qCNYcSx-sQ"

"I love the hippy and organic atmosphere of this happy, healthy joint. It has minimal seating however, so just took my meal to go! For the average American stomach, this amount of food per plate might not be enough to fill you, so order a smoothie or juice with your meal to keep yourself full and satisfied! The people there are really nice and accommodating, and they have free lemon and lime water! Great little diamond in the rough for sure.","2014-08-06","0","3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ","g3f_BjM5jQkYetn_J9LKew"

"A year ago I moved back to AZ from Asia after 20 years abroad. I love Indian food and after trying 6-7 local places, I had given up on finding good Indian food. 
Based upon the reviews I tried Shalimar  and must say the food and service are excellent! 
The owner is very cordial and makes you feel at home. The food is fresh and is by far the best I've had in AZ. The real deal 
For sure.","2013-06-28","0","yy_FhzQCeLreV21OBccPAg","jfsJull3XfnkW9P7SybmOg"

"I take my mother here; she seems pleased with the doctors, but the NP Mrs Schlesinger had me concerned.  She was fidgety, CHEWING on her hair, (really!), stuck her finger in her mouth by her back molars to dig out some food, & then wiped it on her own skirt, and a few other mannerisms that made me feel like she was on meth or opioids. My mother (86) told me afterwards that she didn't even recognize her from the previous visit.

The chicken was tender, the rice was bland,  it was hard and old. Like it was sitting for a couple of days and I got the last of it. Disgusting! ! I told the young lady who took my order, she kindly went to the back got more rice on another paper plate and gave it to me, reminder:the old rice is still on my plate.

I'm originally from Peru and I was very disappointed. I ordered anticuchos and jalea. Anticuchos tasted ok but these were ridiculous small pieces for $10. The jalea had barely any seasoning and the picante lacked some salt. I live in florida and I'm used to eat a good portion size of food for less money.

The empanada was one sliced in half so it was a small portion but the taste was delicious the pitcher lasted us the whole meal (and it was happy hour 50% off drinks)","2013-09-30","0","kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw","9wPgNP8nzUXdChRLFzcnFQ"

"Not good!  Ordered Penne with Grilled Chicken.  Very saucy but even worse was the chicken that tasted like dry powder and several days old.  Wine and beer overpriced at $8 a glass and Corona at $4.50 each.  Also had Lasagna which was better but the sausage seemed as old as the chicken.  Only good thing was the garlic knots which came out fresh and hot.  Wish they had a little more fresh garlic on them though but still good.

"Buy their bulk ammo with caution. I purchased 250 rounds of 9mm from them a few times and they are great. However, I actually sat down and counted the ammo in the box and I was missing 43 rounds. I was told that some people open the box up and put some more ammo in their box and there really isn't anything they can do about it... I feel like taping up the box with a sticker or something would resolve this.. Anyways, aside from that great guys and store","2017-04-25","0","Jj9F27mlp00IJQuPtAePPQ","AlrKpOQYhDM_kh9QncOsjQ"

"McKenzie & James have the worst attitude.  Not management material. Neither seems to care about other people,  or animals.  90% of the animals there get sick.  A parrot named big bird that lived there,  until recently,  was always stuck in her cage and  some employees would tell her to shut up because she would yell.  Fake pet store.  There are a couple of good people there. Oh,  and don't give them your email address,  or prepare to get email EVERY DAY,  until you block them.","2016-10-02","0","3O5nZKcnly1S9wdjPYDMUw","2xQrKV-XON9BVj0HBY2YSA"

"I had been wanting to come for a while as my friends came by and told us we had to go. I wish we would've came sooner. The place made me feel like I was in Alice in Wonderland. The tea party feel. It's so warm inside. 

We decided to get just some appys as we were going out afterwards. We got the scallops, meatballs, langosta, and the gnocchi. My bf's favorite was the scallops and mine was the gnocchi. That pesto sauce is so delicious!! Can't wait to go back and try more","2014-09-22","0","sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ","pDvYuO3Z4CmyZtvWdCwjyg"

Lobby  is a little small for the number of rooms and there is only one dining room. Food is decent but nothing special.  The staff is nice but there are too few of them. The village outside is cute.

"One of worst experiences ever. We arrived Saturday afternoon, as soon as we were seated, the waiters ignored us for quiet a while and were clueless on whose section we were part of. Then one waitress decided to finally come over, without saying much, left a menu and disappeared. After reappearing, the waitress had very lousy attitude and we felt like we had to beg for service....we were offended as this place lacked any caring for customer service.

"If you have not tried a FREE workout at OTF yet, you must!! Seeing everyone else's heart rate and calories burned on the big screen does keep you motivated and if you have injury that prevents you from doing certain types of movements. Let the trainer know before class starts and they are able to think of an alternative to work the same muscle group.","2017-12-04","0","XPzsPT1NHN0CIhRHXZjMWA","L4iT9ZCNxS2YxTzc2G5ucg"

"The food at all 3 Cibo locations (King St. \/ Yonge St. & Yorkville) consistently disappoints!!!

Yesterday for a quick business lunch I decided to give this place another chance and again was disappointed 

The Ahi tuna salad was terrible, the tuna tasted cooked rather than properly seared and the dressing was bland. 

I guess the only reason you might wanna walk into a Cibo is to have drinks. 

I would never eat at any Cibo anymore!

"I have never stepped into a salon that was as amazing as this one! I was pampered and it was so relaxing!. Atmosphere was perfect and they have all the trendy polish and designs!. The toilet was so unique too :). A must check out before or after your service too. Its like a BURKE WILLIAMS but dedicated to all nails and facial . They have so many wax rooms and a full facial service. Endless varieties of pedicure types, lotions, and creams! All your pampering needs after a long day of work! :)","2014-02-23","0","FOqYmI24hSVP4EUibW-9zQ","3veJrvnvQIsNYVjBSufA9Q"

I was overdue for a trim and she took off just enough to make my hair look healthy and still keep my length for long layers. We took our time and it was all about me and my hair, no rush. She helped me pick the right products for my hair and I got a great deal!

"We heard negative things about this place since changing from ""The Strike Zone"" to ""Memo's"".  But, they were so WRONG!!!  The decor was bright w\/artistic photographs of Route 66.  Menu has a nice variety of American dishes along with ""daily specials"".  The server, Cheyenne, was very congenial & provided us with samples of  homemade Jambalaya & chili.  I went with the Jambalya (daily special) & my husband had the meat loaf.  We will definitely return for a light casual reasonably priced meal.","2014-04-03","0","Xb7jOAa17xtT_uA4sCCAsg","-sQEEUkAXwou6PxTg5zRTA"

"If you go in early on a weekend morning (when there are only 2 servers), sit on the left side of the restaurant. Both servers are very pleasant, but after many experiences with the one on the right, we grew frustrated with her seeming to be constantly overwhelmed. The one who works the left side is very much on-top of everything and never needs to be asked twice.","2014-06-01","0","v7In1lSZCIiku3o0yIXIRQ","NYGhZJbiV04XMzoHIOBSoA"

"What a rip off. Do not order their terriaki chicken or terriaki beef with vegetables dish. Got a little snack sized dish with BEANSPROUTS for vegetables. Ate both dishes and was still hungry. EACH dish was 9.95! I could go to congee wong and order a nice dish for 7.95 and its more tasty and id be full! Their seafood ramen is VERY watery and tasteless. Only one shrimp and some other crap. STAY away from this restaurant youve been warned.","2013-11-14","0","ElBSe2oRxM-ozNXitx_f1g","f20lzCRK-zN0Vhyqnaqdcw"

I definitely wouldn't suggest going here in a large group. the waitresses were overly concerned with getting everyone in the groups alcohol order over our food order. after getting the ""New Yorker"" I can understand why.

"Was in town for leasure and needed a quick touch up on my sides and back. I enjoy barbershops and this was a close one in the area. Although the guys are talented at what they do my experience was a little disheartening. I went in for a ""line up"" from what I understood was a clipper trim up that was listed for $12 on there website. At the end the total was $30.    Shocker. So just a heads up, it's cash only and no services or prices listed. Know what your getting into.","2016-12-13","0","lpfuJoqC_kGZcvk4diZkHw","l5_RgcWDVteIgrlWla8txw"

"My favorites... 911 roll, sexy girl, chef's #1 choice, shrimp lover, and wet dream.  To finish off your meal, try the ""Monkey Brain"" sushi.  Tastes almost like dessert.  It's filled with some sort of banana filling in the middle.  It's to die for!

"This tip is for the management of the establishment, not the patrons. 

If your power goes out and you decide to comp meals, do it for everyone.

It is very disappointing that since you don't know how to use the old fashioned carbon imprints, you made a crayon rubbing of one patron's card and realized you don't want to deal with that anymore.

I would highly recommend this store to anyone who has tried to quit smoking or who is currently into vaping. Stop by and check out the store and see what they have to offer.  I also have been able to get family members to quit smoking and in fact no one in the family smokes any more because of the Vapery Storey.

"Very good food, I had the cowboy burger and cheese curds and my friend had the patty melt and sweet potato fries. The fries themselves where we'll prepared, they where cut thick, cooked to have a little crunch on the outside and soft on the inside.

Jay makes you feel right at home n is very helpful and informative n making the best decision for your vaping needs. The product is great quality for affordable prices and the juice is amazing! Try the dragon fruit its my personal fav :) So if your already vaping or looking to start, Up in Vapor is the place to be.","2013-07-21","0","skm5ZkoYsrDDLAhEhGiMLQ","mIUe7hjohT6focndx0-mNA"

"Wow! If you want a fresh, healthy twist to our homestyle Hawaiian local food, you Must come here. My first try is an awesome kalua pork salad! Island favs with a fresh flare. When you get tired of deep fried breaded brown chicken and mac salad, give these guys a try. I love it so much that I'm figuring out how to do my first post via Yelp!

"Best time to go is lunch. Worst time is the last hour and a half before they close.  Our family has gotten burned several times with rock  hard rice, brown lettuce and extremely salty pork (like they were trying to mask something). We're always enjoyed the afternoon service. They even let us order a few minutes before they opened. Extremely nice of them!  Oh, and the food was as delicious as we are used to.  Nothing has stopped us from going,  we're just mindful of the time of day.","2014-07-19","0","1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ","SmuqmcoBmy2sYJmQF5yCZw"

"Do not go here! Run far from this place if you plan to get a weave. They probably braid very well but as for weaves, don't let them tell you they can do your weave or that it will look nice because the fact is they truly can't weave worth a damn! They have the nerve to call what they do a ""technique"". They will try to send you out of the shop looking like you let a blind 3 year old sew perfectly good hair in with yarn. You'll leave feeling like you got robbed. Look at the pics, it's a hot mess!","2016-04-30","0","F6WE0-RPzRKPrBcJYVmNCg","m47ZFm6kbiYMyPe6YzElLg"

"I wouldn't waste your time. This location is doomed. Should have got the hint when someone came in answering a Craig's list add during our meal (I hope it was for a cook). My wife and I had chicken sandwiches. I had the fuel inferno and the wife the fuel griller. Both were tasteless. The appetizer was   Stuffed peppers and that was pretty good. The cucumber martini was great. Atmosphere two thumbs down. Bathroom needed a good cleaning. I give them 6 months.","2013-08-22","0","a8GHS5-NifRLGgbrqajUJg","ZOTSiJV48PGwGsiYT1FVLQ"

"Hate this place. They call you over 10 times in a day, they call your reference's number over and over again, you can make returns but you still have to it off, all of their crap is way over priced, they're rude and inconsiderate, they talk over and interrupt you, the only way you can get a word in is yelling at them.

"My girls have been enrolled in this dance studio for a month now and are loving every minute! We have had the chance to meet and dance with every instructor, each of them are great with kids as well as keeping parents involved. I would recommend this studio to anyone looking for a fun dance place to bring their kids\/teens\/and even themselves! They have adult classes :)","2013-10-20","0","_yo2j6IWRHBgRd2zBVXrow","glAqiCioxLQZ2J1IOjZIJA"

"My 2nd poor experience. Our server was inattentive. Our wine was never decanted and we ended having to get up and pour our own. 1 person in our party ordered a steak and it came out at least 15 min after the rest of our party's meals. When it  was brought out it was way over done. They said sorry & offered to buy us drinks but by that time our meals were done. It was a very disappointing experience & after this I will not return and will be sure to not recommend this restaurant in the future.","2017-02-23","0","t6FCO31z5uYrCM26jCaIaA","vubmtzml_ozOpCQqmrE9VQ"

"Favorite vintage rentals and prop styling business in Las Vegas! Veronica pays great detail when telling her exactly what you're looking for. Shes extremely sweet and friendly oh and of course CREATIVE! I definitely recommend nostalgia resources for styling weddings, engagement, bridal, portrait, family, & lifestyle shoots in Las Vegas. Their inventory list is amazingly gorgeous and will bring your photoshoot to a whole new level!

Misrepresentation of their fleet of trailers, rvs, etc. Renae is confrontational, unwilling to help customer!

The sauce ordinary,a bit too much with hardly any cheese or sausage The sausage here used to be the only sausage I could eat in LV but it is not at all the same and is now just ok.Also got the mediumwings, they were plain just a hint of sauce  barely any meat on the tiny pigeon wings Palermo calls chicken wings...maybe an ounce of meat per wing.

"Horrible. If you think you're getting made to measure, you're not. Had to go back twice for shirts that didn't fit. Apparently (according to the employee) everything is made in China! They take measurements (badly, at that), have the suits, shirts etc., made cheaply in China, then sell them to you AS IF they're tailor made.  They use industry standards - crazy! Go to any retail store and pay half the price.","2015-08-23","0","9hnyuencQIbpw8La9Fv0JQ","a17czh62Cwi9Pw53AE53Mw"

"They are usually good but tonight, on the worst night of my life, I think the waiter forgot my order. 15 mins onwards, I had to remind them of my poke salad. Then came my grilled salmon collar...guess what? The fish had a funky smell. After one bite, I had to return it. I was super disappointed and hungry. But, this too shall pass and it's not a good thing. I don't think I'm coming back ever again.","2016-09-20","0","W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg","BEZfvfifZ1ya5coMlVoO5w"

"I've gone here 3 times including today's visit and although they have great prices and massages I felt pressured to leave a higher tip. I usually leave between $5-$10 and they acted like it wasn't enough when they asked if I'm leaving a tip and I said how much the owner I think spoke to the guy who massaged me and they're both Asian so I didn't know what they said but I got the impression as if they didn't appreciate the tip and just wanted more.

First of all, I'm 19 weeks pregnant and left work because i had trouble breathing and have a history of miscarriage & potiential asthma. the process at first seemed good but after a couple hours it got far worse. I waited forever to have a Doppler done on my legs and then the nurse was very rude and one of the other doctos over heard her and agreed she was being unprofessional so for that I'm reporting her.

"Went to happy hour with a group of teacher friends on Friday. Seating was very limited, we felt like we were seated in the lobby of a small hotel! The bartender seemed less than happy to accommodate us especially because we asked for separate checks, before we ordered. H.H. Food was fine but microscopic in size. The gin and tonic I ordered was good but who messes that up? All in all I probably won't be back as we didn't feel very welcome.","2017-05-13","0","igHYkXZMLAc9UdV5VnR_AA","s_Bj02n-ZtNVM89C_89RdQ"

"This place is in close proximity of my house so it's nice to be able to walk over and have a beer. But this places has sub-par food that is way over priced for the quality & what you get. The bartenders are a bit preoccupied with their friends or regulars that the rest of us have to wait up to 40 minutes for another drink. The management and\/or owner really needs to evaluate their staff and food if they want to stay in business!

They do this as a full time job (not a side hobby\/part time job like most companies do.) They are an amazing group of talented individuals who really care to make their customers happy.

"This is a great gym, especially if your new to fitness or coming off a long layoff. Yes the weights don't go as heavy as more standard gyms which would be my only gripe; However, thats a smarter way to train if you're just starting out or making a comeback. Slow progress is the best progress when it comes to fitness. It allows your body time to adjust to training. And with a calmer and less intense atmosphere that helps you to focus on simply improving.","2016-07-11","0","4DtjA7EoxUSyWiXEuElPVA","00KBvm45X3IJosDyEgsVDA"

"I have been shopping here for several years because you could usually find a designer item in excellent condition for a reasonable price. But the last few years I have noticed  that the quality is no longer there. Their clothing is old, worn out, dirty, torn and buttons or zippers broken. I guess buyer beware when you shop there. Also, many items are not designer anymore....you will even see clothing from Costco, H&M, Target, etc. I would rather buy new for the non-designer items.","2015-12-19","0","NOtdhHE4oTaODsJgW8GXPA","iN0u63tMoLI71VT5sTeJUA"
"Terrible customer service. Lots of clothing in poor condition. Also noticed them carrying brands like forever 21 which is not something their customers are looking for. I was going to buy a free people top until I noticed three stains plus pulling in the chiffon. Granted these were fairly minimal and normally I would have bought the top regardless. However due to their complete lack of customer service I decided to pass. I have previous experience consigning which they are also terrible at.","2015-02-16","0","NOtdhHE4oTaODsJgW8GXPA","FT9mWIXyAL4SY2T5x2YrmQ"

They definitely didn't hold back on the cheese. I can't stand when you order a pizza and there's hardly any cheese. The flavor of the pizza was just as great. I was shocked when I got on yelp and saw the bad reviews. Maybe it was cuz they were still just opening? Very happy with the food and customer service, top notch.

"Poor customer service.  Today we experienced a ""manager"" (term used very loosely), make us feel that it was our fault for not being aware of their non-substitution policy for veggies.  Very odd situation because as we pointed out that their employee who took the order did not mention an up-charge for substitutions they were not apologetic in any way.  Refused to refund the difference.

"So glad I went with Saba!!! After a NIGHTMARE scenario the day of my wedding on 12\/10\/2016, I had to fire Mirage Limousines due to fraudulent acts of changing all the terms of what we agreed to (including the time they would pick me up from our wedding reception, the type of car, and the cost). I called Saba Limo just an hour before the ceremony began in desperation to get a ride scheduled for later that evening for my wife and I to our hotel. They came through in the clutch!!!

"Greetings!!
I visited this restaurant and it's really good one!!
I found myself eating food (kibdah and ma'soub) just like the ones in my hometown, Makkah, I really enjoyed the food and their prices are very reasonable and affordable.
I advise everyone to go there. Even you are Muslim or not you will enjoy decent fresh food.
One last thing, authenticy guaranteed because the owners who make the recipe are Saudis from AlMadinah Almonorah, so they definitely know how to prepare our special food.","2013-10-22","0","5MxHxh4O5BgpQuuPBElvWg","veOKqGFt2HQgYf-H2-OP-A"

I have eaten here a total of 3 times now and i think I've kind of figured them out: they are nice, well-meaning people, but can't be consistent. The first time I ate here, the food was really good and the service fine and good. The other two times, not so much. The atmosphere you cannot argue with, but they need to get the kitchen in order and the wait staff, while very friendly, needs to be more efficient, period.","2016-04-17","0","dNr7VKRti8dXWE-jzfVBtQ","h0DLKYdpbcHRVZx2BFW42g"

The mac n cheese was cold. The waffle fries were good though. Service was slow. Took 15 minutes just to order and it was practically empty. If you want good bbq then go to rollin smoke.

The fries were also re-cooked. We had two glasses of wine and a beer and the total of all three drinks was $29. A little pricey for a sports bar in Pittsburgh if you ask me. Also the communication between the manager and the servers was poor. Nice atmosphere but overpriced and average food.","2014-04-07","0","0EcCWB9_VxTOoAh_1Wr_RQ","Kv_uoXtTgUDf4eewg-kmIw"

"One tip is that the waitstaff seem to get busy and disappear for long periods of time in the kitchen. It can take some time for the server to recognize that you're finished eating and bring you the bill. If you're in a rush it can be a waste of time to wait to flag them down. I don't bother waiting for the bill and I just walk to the cash register at the front when I'm done. They usually spot me from the kitchen and I'm paid up very quickly.","2013-11-14","0","sSWy-yEYPCHLss0LvmAhhA","vN5zGsljpV_LmBEAfhjDvA"

Altho i had a bottle of bug repellent in my hands that i picked up off the floor that was in the back seat which was used during our fishing trip. I also asked him if there was an outside trash can i could use to toss the can out which he replied ""no"".... really.

We just tried a few small dishes and a cocktail each. The octopus didn't blow our minds and the drinks were a little expensive for the size but the Pig Candy was yummy! I would totally give this place a shot.","2017-10-20","0","SmkYLXEYhzwUZdS6TAevHg","d50KnSCad1YcZ58UUIDr_Q"

"The front desk was polite and friendly upon check in.  The room (438) was enormous for a hotel room.   Unfortunately it also smells like an ashtray.    Upon trying to switch rooms, I learned the hotel is a sell out, so they quickly offered an ionizer for the room while I was out.    It's in the bedding, the leather headboard, the pillows.   I've never experienced such an overpowering stench of stale cigarettes.  The toilet is filthy, as well.  Not a place I will return to.","2016-06-08","0","jDx6XkcKhX7llMlBrvNofw","dbF0U9ii5k3M0moxEt1nOg"

"Stopped here last evening after the Stevie Nicks concert and ordered a couple ""late lunch"" dishes. The truffle fries were very good- not greasy but plenty of flavor from the truffle oil and Parmesan cheese. A giant meatball was our second choice - also very tasty and well flavored. Really enjoyed the ambiance and although our waitress was attentive, other staff seems a. It fliers as they cleaned around us and opened a big door which blew a tiny dryad in right on us.","2017-04-01","0","wY3dlpLa0BHfDENYAPYuZA","ivSyr1a8Z4L9v0sgzMOuZw"

We happened to get seated right away but didn't enjoy the 20 min wait for service. Countless waitresses just kept walking past our table without coming to see if we have been helped. It was only when my friend went back up to the hostess to complain did they realize. At that time the hostess was nice enough to walk over..","2014-09-20","0","ID7WUBLnhkdxp8QrjsssZg","df9Oy09pIc6MZGB1qel0YQ"

"This may have been the worst food I have had in over 10 years. It was horribly bland.  We mentioned that our drinks tasted ""off"" many times before the bartender realized the soda was not operating properly, no compensation or corrective actions were made.  Our busser was one of the most delightful people I've ever encountered, but our server never once smiled, tho she was pleasant. The selection of bourbons was quite limited, which seemed strange for a place called ""Double Barrel"".  Never again","2014-04-21","0","foQZ6guS0l49trURKh7vlA","k8Hm1TK7zF5G9AiuSIlcCg"

And at one of the turnouts your have the choice to take an unmaintained road..... we took it for like a quarter mile before we decided we did NOT want to risk popping our tires so we did u turn to get back (it's literally a gravel road). But overall, if you want to explore something outside of Vegas, come here :) don't forget to check out the visitor center first because the scenic tour exits you completely out of the area.","2013-08-02","0","odyYR1Bg2bqmp1kVlm8OYw","bVA6dAMy-bc9KTFbEOCSyQ"

"The place to go in Tempe for breakfast! Came to town for Pats Run and went all 4 mornings, getting something different every time. Sweet potato pancakes are my favorite but it was all good, and a ton of food for the price, other places in town charge twice as much for a third the amount of food! We'll be back next year!","2014-04-27","0","TkgEHV_4Qmamb_wUvkgdTg","sTJFrSxEas6QOVg9PUg-8w"

"Used to be my favorite place to eat until they started changing the whole menu.  The little side salad was my favorite salad to get and a big part of why I would eat here in the first place. To feel good and healthy while still enjoying my food to the fullest.  That salad is gone.  The chicken patties and the burgers have gotten noticeably smaller, and they changed the cheddar cheese they were using on the burger giving it a completely different taste.  Smh :-(
