"My girlfriend and I stopped in January 1, 2014 for an evening meal.  She gets the trio off of happy menu and it arrives COLD!!!!!!!
We send it back and we are not complainers because she works in industry.
We wait awhile and she gets 2nd try and that is cold. We were sitting at bar.
We ask for manager and  or nephew of owner finally stops by and did not listen to a word my girlfriend had to say...
All he could say was she tried some of the food so he WOULD NOT comp meal.

"Wish I saw this review before I sent them my hard earned money. Long story short. Saw a coin online I needed for my collection. Ordered it and paid with US Postal money order. No coin sent after empty promises and they refuse to send back a refund. Ehsan told me that their supplier stiffed them after stalling me so long so be careful in advance. They don't have in inventory what they post as available online and once they have your money, it's gone. Buyer beware!","2013-06-27","0","YSIK0E1E2GZ7jIls_v8aSw","OBwF-J0RYip9o4ZI7DPLTg"

"Let me start off my saying I love pink spot. Up intell today I have had nothing but great experiences. I was having an issue with my battery so I took it in. Come to find out it was something I could have fixed at home. But the young lady who helped me make me feel so stupid for not knowing this. She was also rude when I was trying to choose a new flavor. I know you are all the experts but you should not be making us newbies feel stupid. Very disappointing.","2014-03-12","0","fYSsuT30m6lR_OzVjUGz_g","9pLC8tXeWIsZRYm_33WfUQ"

By far the best juice I've had the honor to vape. I look forward to my return and the new drip bar. Couldn't get the full flavor from your tanks but juice was WAY better when I got my bottle. I can not thank you enough for the experience. I would like to see a glass bottle option but not complaining. Thanks again","2014-04-28","0","8UyT00RWePMYO5ZFQXGlqg","Bw7u2L6VAPPpoXCTaxr_kQ"

I requested my condiments on the side. When my meal arrived the blackberry jam described in the menu was nothing more than a single serving of Smuckers grape jelly. Really???

It was like walking on fly paper and when I tried to move my feet I had to put some serious effort behind it.  The bathrooms were less than stellar as well with floors that had NOT been mopped and counters that were a true ICKK factor.

"I guess I was spoiled with gramma T's homemade food back home. I just found the catfish here at soul food cafe was bland. Not seasoned enough. Potatoe salad was too relishy. Tasted boxed, with a little touch up. And the greens were too plain. Great flavor, but needed some hammocks. The cornbread was great. Yams were good, just needed to be a little darker and stickier. 
Coming back of course to try ribs.

"One Tip - NEVER GO TO THIS TERRIBLE PLACE. FOOD IS HORRIBLE (Frozen then de-frosted taste and smell), SERVICE IS EVEN WORSE. NO JAPANESE CHEF AT THIS JAPANESE NOODLE SHOP! ANYONE can look into their Open Kitchen and see there are only 4 Hispanic Cooks in the kitchen and that is it. No wonder their Japanese dishes tastes ABSOLUTELY NOT Japanese! The waitresses all speaks and acts as everyone in the world owes them money.

"A bit overpriced for the portions...but nevertheless food is good. Service not all that great. They're really nice but trying too hard.  Might be under staffed. Took forever to get a hold of my waiter. I wasn't sure whose my waiter whose the helper and whose the person who checks in to see how ""everything"" is. Menu is very appealing. I will try coming back to give another try...hope they can redeem themselves with better service.

"Jude did an amazing cut and color on my hair today. I had about 5-6 inches cut off into an updated asymmetrical layered bob. It is absolutely beautiful. And she added some partial highlights to warm it up and give it some depth. Best cut and style I've had in ages and her prices are very reasonable for the quality of work!

"Got introduced to boba by a friend a few years ago and ever since then I've loved it. I've tried a few boba places in Vegas but this place stands out in my opinion. Mostly the menu, so many option\/flavors to choose from. I think this place has the best boba and the owner is very helpful and kind. If you love boba like me, I say give this place a try, not only boba but lots of sweets to choose from as well","2015-08-08","0","IBKNR0-FL_Y5KzXqA1yS4A","5u4wbm3C518Rtob3Zcqf3w"

"The place is hiding, you need to make a trip to find it. But when you get there all your trip effort is NOT WORTH IT. The service is very very bad as if they don't want you to go there. And when placing an order its better to for you to write it down Coz no matter how many times you repeat it they have a hard time understanding you. And as a result you'll get a wrong order and when. You tell them they will never apologize and instead get Mad at you. Management pls check on your people.","2016-04-14","0","IBKNR0-FL_Y5KzXqA1yS4A","rf4Nq_2WnLhsUDNCEtTqbA"
"Nice store inside but service is very BAD due to the rude crew. No greetings, Chinese crew don't know how to apologize when they made a mistake in your order because she can't understand well.

"Another success story today thanks to Bob. Last year our yellow lab Honey jumped up and knocked over a three year old boy. Today while taking a walk with two yellow labs we were surrounded by 4 children ages 3 to 6 and both Rocky and Honey sat there on command and let the children pet, talk and walk around them. It was the best distraction test yet and the dogs passed with amazing results. Thank you Bob so much as we now have well-behaved dogs in public after 3 lessons.","2016-03-20","0","7VfktTKK-ixMGdS2K71Urw","Il8MN95AbJQhdpvTOCGrYw"

I would definitely come back. So often burger places over cook the meat, but not in this case. Reading the menu was entertaining in itself.

When you travel 120 days a year, and you're only halfway through an 8 day trip, and you're tired and smelly from rushing to the airport after you've overslept, and you really don't want Starbucks coffee, you will want to go to Cartel.

The side door was open though (this was around 12:15pm, no noticed before then?). Ordered honey BBQ wings and a cheesesteak. The cheesesteak tasted like hamburger & cheese whiz, the wings had definite freezer burn, we threw away more than half.

"Never go to JaBistro again. This is what I ordered tonight and I usually don't like raw stuff so I specifically asked waitress to recommend any cooked food for me. They told me the sushi is well-done. However, I suffered my first Food Poisoning experience after eating. 30 mins finishing this meal, I started to get a big headache and a little dizzy while walking outside. Later, I went back home and suffered serious diarrhea and vomited 4 times throughout the night.","2017-12-04","0","Qmwfg-PtYuCo5Q_IwcA_HQ","7SYRrkP8v8Pz_lGYuaTgNA"

"If you park in the covered garage on a weekday, you can get your parking ticket validated for the first hour so you'll usually won't have to pay anything out of pocket. If you park on the weekend, however, the city raises the parking fees by a few cents. So after having MTO validate your parking ticket, you'll end up paying 75 cents out of pocket for the first hour on a weekend. You can also try to find street parking as well.","2014-06-02","0","ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg","4QmQi3dNNVBRoclybsHACw"

"Eating guide:
Step 1: pick the soup. Note that with each soup, it comes with assorted side dish for the soup and some meat as well. You don't need extra meat if you are not feeling the meat.

Step 2: once the soup arrive (caution, soup is HOT), immediately put the necessary topping into the soup to cook it.

Step 3: eat the noodle, again, the bowl holding the soup is hot. You have 2 choices, eat straight from the bowl or take it out and eat the noodle from a seperate bowl.","2017-08-25","0","aR0dWZeGyDjVpgJfBqYdpQ","5hbSXejhP-5b1cSe8XwJDw"

"I happened upon Envy Nails on Thanksgiving Day when my mom was in town visiting. From the minute we walked in the door,  my mom and I were welcomed by Andy and his wife. We were treated like guests in their home. I received the best pedicure I have had. Not only was it the best massage but also included warm lotion and hot rocks to follow it up. The entire experience was so relaxing and perfect. I have gone there ever since and would not go anywhere else. It is worth every penny.","2013-04-21","0","fKPVcdtvnyoGiGMrR9aoVw","iA3jlKKLC_I33d2RPJKr9w"

"Wow! I really enjoyed my trip to the salon today. As usual, my hands and feet look and feel GREAT, but as a nice little pre-holiday relaxation fun, I was witness to some HYSTERICAL friendly banter between Andy and a couple of his technicians. It was like a front-row seat to my own personal comedy show. What a nice way to unwind before the bustling of Christmas!!","2013-12-23","1","fKPVcdtvnyoGiGMrR9aoVw","4oYEAJz9_eg3Y8TiJZLc2g"
"Well I was satisfied with them but not this visit. :( I called in the morning to make a appt with specific techs. One of them tried to get off with doing my guests pedicure but I reminded him that the appt was made for him so he did it. I made an appt with Andy but he sent another tech to do my pedicure while he did another woman's nails. The 'new' tech cut me and made me bleed. I NEVER bled before. And she did my pedi real fast. After a stressful day at work this is NOT what I expected :(","2013-07-10","0","fKPVcdtvnyoGiGMrR9aoVw","7I0sq0Qx1bhd7-NwwXYuEQ"

"I was not impressed with the customer service interaction during my first visit to Brandy Melville. All I wanted to know was whether the stock  and price was same across Canada. The sales lady not only looked at me as if I was stupid, but she talked to me as if I was. She looked fed up and irritated that I was asking her a question or two. I don't think I'll go back if my first impression of the store was curt, unfriendly and condescending.","2016-03-11","0","cx-eQP9HDe8mjzK_ML4gkA","7PS041GLJ_k7bWQKu9_Cjg"

We took the 2hr tour & were covered in dust from head to toe at the end (you have so much fun that you don't even realize you are in the dust)!

Several beer and food stations where you can run a tab and it applies to all (so you don't have to keep going to the same spot). Good selection of beer. You can get food from the food truck or a full meal from inside. Lots of room to roam.

The reservation guy so rude n start screaming and swearing. In the ends JJ the server guy always awesome as ever. The bill came of $107. We were a bit tipsy so they decided to scam us by charging $121 instead. Check the bill twice and never order those orders..

Well, because the food was cold, was sitting pre made, microwaved and sent out. I kid you not, the beef skewers were warm outside and COLD inside.. Same with salmon croquettes, the shrimps too. Fried calamari was probably killed alive in salt cuz, thats how salty it was. Cherry on top, the waiter had terrible BO!","2013-07-21","0","10RFV-vuQ52VUkmzFXbWaA","rgiG41eduynCPPqGywgj8g"

We got sat at a dirty table that was never cleaned until our food came (despite the fact we asked three times). When the waitress cleared out table, she spilt a glass of water on my lap. She offered to buy me a beer ( which she never did) after the water was on my pants and phone. 

It took over an hour for our food. Our check had drinks on it that we never ordered.  If it's during a busy event or a Pirates game, don't even bother.","2013-09-27","0","TYZIMuHwhZo_Hizenmf8Pg","_WZOZE2kAZre4hN_yzojaQ"

Well, all they are Learning is to drink excessively, make a mess of the surrounding neighborhoods and disrupting the surrounding Tempe residents by throwing glass bottles from their balconies onto other property and their matienence crew doesn't give a shit about it either.

I always get gel nails and I've had some horrible experiences elsewhere until I found this place after getting a tip.

They do blood work and you have to call constantly just to get a response on labs or elevate the matter. Then when they do call back, they have to tell you IN-PERSON what's going on. They're not worth the trouble or frustration. Find another doctor and practice is my advice.","2015-03-01","0","1NJPR31R-LNvDTcY_NaPmQ","JnS_9P4To2scne5z4ky5sg"

The honey jalapeño that came with the sweet fries and the aioli and the ketchup that came with the truffle fries are very good.

I'd give them 5 stars on the shakes. 3-4 on the fries and 3-4 on the burgers. That being said, my standards are fairly high and overall, not bad, but not great.","2013-04-08","0","cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g","pzSpERslswEEF23OWSTBVQ"

"The chicken burger was very good - the highlight of the meal. Fries were a little too rich (truffle oil and parm?). Farm burger was cooked well and the duck bacon was tasty; however, they committed a cardinal sin: overcooking the fried egg. The yoke was nearly solid when it should have been very runny. Overall an okay meal but nothing to suggest that burgers are their specialty.","2013-05-27","0","cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g","slvOBlJPuycV9Mn2VS17Nw"

The truffle fries were delicious and gobbled up in minutes! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the euro burger, not so much the chicken one. 

I would say if ever going to a Gordon Ramsay or any acclaimed chef's restaurant, always get what that particular restaurant specializes in.","2015-06-20","0","cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g","DovLJYXFz0Je5ZPBARZljQ"

I have nothing bad to say about this spot.  Now I have a reason to go back before next tuesday!  See taco Tuesday starts at 2pm and its 2:08pm when I ordered (see pic)  Not sure why it didnt honor the deal but like i said, they fixed it and were very polite about it.

"This place at first looked like a good place to have authentic Korean food.  
We were far from it.  Banchan was a small plate of kimchi that we had to cut ourselves and a really small plate of pickled radish.  Wow!  That was it.  Then we waited almost 40 minutes for the main course.  Every time we asked for something else like refilling our tea or a bowl of rice (which they charge extra when ordering any stew!) it took almost ten minutes.  To say the least we will never come back.","2013-05-14","0","04HfzvvANCF3hd-yx6ZACw","c7vShA9u-mYgcjVEQYFhIQ"

Now as for the quality of hair that can be purchased at the weave scene and the lady that installed my hair horrible!  They charge for every little thing.

My only problem was last time a table of employees. All on their phones and many talking about smoking weed and hating their job. I don't give a shit about smoking weed or hating your job, but please do this somewhere else. I don't wanna hear that shit while I'm eating my awesome burger. #donthireidiottrendykids.

In the eight years we have lived here in Henderson there has been no local Chicago style food that lives up to the reputation of the Windy City food. The quality and way they prepare the hot dogs is as good as you can get in Chicago.  The Italian beef is awesome too.

"Burgers were really good.  You should be pretty hungry to have the regular burgers- the ""little"" (slightly less than 1\/4 lb) are enough otherwise.
Fries were tasty too, but I think they gave us one PEI field's worth of potatoes for a ""little"" and a ""regular"". Can't imagine how much we would have received for a ""large"".

"This is THE ABSOLUTE WORST Shoeless Joes location. STAY AWAY! The service is absolutely horrible! And the food as well! Went with a group of people we all ordered wings with sauce on them, the sauce was drizzled on, there was barely anything on them! And the wings were so dry as well! If we wanted plain wings we would have asked for that instead! Service is horrible and so are wait times...went there 2 years ago, decided never to go back, but we did and nothing has changed. STAY AWAY!","2014-11-09","0","AJVS93SEUPzn63m2ogYNwQ","DeaxfuQxYdBNXvy2kfSI-g"
"The only place I will ever go to get tattooed. I stand by Reverent Tattoo and everyone who works here. They are all friendly, knowledgable, and talented. You will not be disappointed. The shop is beautiful, comfortable, friendly, and most importantly clean. They are always honest, upfront, and give you exactly what you pay for... a beautiful piece of art. I have three pieces done and am going for my fourth next month! I will always be a Reverent girl.","2014-05-27","0","w0uLRVXNwqyxouspWrTq9A","4bKRj0dGrerSAYVaoaI0DA"

The same lady that was running the front desk provided my nail service. It was rough and choppy.  I confronted her about it and left right away.on my way out the askes rudely ""wait, no tip?""

Anyways i had cut and wash with Jeffrey.
I wasn't specific since I didn't really have any style in mind but only the length i want.

He did a good job. Place was neat. Got offered tea but they got set up before i could get a chance to drink it lolz :) and the massage was great too. 
I love my new look. :))

"Super disappointed! Walked in there looking to buy a new flavor. The nice taller man with a Mohawk up sold us into two new flavors, a new battery, & a tank. He was AWESOME! He ten explained it would be more beneficial to me to just get a new starter kit as it comes with 1 free flavor included and would save me just a little bit of money. Who's not down to save just a bit of money these days? So my husband and I picked my new pink battery, pink tank, a flavor.","2013-07-21","0","gS4ZzhSjdEEFj-lLUbIxWg","cvAOBUm7f8cNgOMvl2JZfQ"

"We sat at the bar and our waiter Rob W. was very informative, knowledgable and he never took long to get anything we needed. He also kept us updated if the dish would take a little longer (which i love). We got the 6 corse favorites, which the chef chooses. Hot plates, hamachi Kama was so good we ordered another round. For chicken, the Karaage was delicious but then again everything was very good. The pricing: for what you get was very reasonable and fair.
We will definalty return.","2013-08-10","0","364hhL5st0LV16UcBHRJ3A","Nn8Oz4HdDAkNeKFiKuk1cw"

"I left a review a while ago on how great the Caesar Salad was here.i have been back several times and it was consistently good. Stopped in today to find out they have made changes to the menu. This includes no longer mixing the dressing into the salad. This changes the taste dramatically The exception dressing is too thick to adequately mix in at the table.     I did appreciate the discussion I had with the Manager about this. He was very open and promised to take it up with corporate.","2017-12-06","0","0Cqkgz8hz8sLYvSkZhBDzQ","9mOnPgqNk1S-kUN0JKi0sw"

Not even my co-worker that claimed it being great could finish her 2 rolls she ordered. The tuna roll looked like tuna out of a can. Just not good sushi place.

"I'm from hawaii where there are Acai bars everywhere! This place, BY FAR, has the worst acai bowls I've ever had. It's like, slush. It's not thick and creamy like I've always had. I don't mind that it's not sweet; because that's what the agave is for. But it was like they blended 1 acai smoothie pack with a bucket of ice. I just don't understand how it came out this way. I also don't understand how they have rave reviews about their bowls. It was DEFINITELY not great. =\","2014-07-22","0","XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw","nl2o0kovLXXU1faZ9H-xYg"

After the drinks came we order several things, we only received half of our initial order. While we were grilling our meat the lady came over and started cutting the meat with what looked to be already used scissors.Do not recommend this place to anyone.

"If you are buying a new kit I suggest finding three or four more flavors you love. Because the kit is 80 dollars. Comes with a case. Charger(under an essentially lifetime warranty). Two batteries(under an essentially lifetime warranty). Four clearomizers (tank that holds your juice and produces vapor). And a bottle of juice. If you get three more bottles of juices that equals to a grand total of $105, you get an extra bottle free of charge. Putting you at five bottles of juices. Worth it!!","2013-05-04","0","h4B4zyivFkXwZvoq7KUrUg","vXBNqGkmcdFNC0c2mvfkww"

"Service was poor, and waitress had an attitude.  Home fries were soggy as well as my wife's hash browns. I had the corned beef hash, which was mediocre at best, however my wife did enjoy her omelette. Save yourself the heartache and just go to an IHOP or Denny's, the food will be better and most likely will the service. I sincerely wanted this to be my new b-fast spot. It just doesn't cut the mustard. If the food appeared as pictured it might be a different story.","2013-06-16","0","J8GuDrqeLH1xMpSpeEixYA","Xj3RFGgzu0PW9P3CXs-rqg"

Not only do they provide an abundant serving, but the food is fresh and extraordinary. We ended the meal with a beignet tree loaded with soft, warm, delicious beignets and a plate of warm mini chocolate chip cookies that melt in your mouth.

"I wish I could agree with the majority here.. I was very unimpressed with this restaurant.  The service was excellent but the food extremely average at best.  

The meatball was below average.  The texture more chewy than delicate. The pasta served before the entree tasted like Chef Boyrdee.  My filet was over cooked and lacked flavor.  Maybe I expected too much. The Outback on The Strip would have been a better choice.  IMHO","2013-10-02","0","z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ","bxBiYX_2GObgek3sGnPhSA"

"Love the atmosphere but was disappointed to read one post above.  Asian bartender is NOT full if himself.... One if the nicest guys I know who makes great drinks and is very humble. Love going to CAVO just for that reason. Only time he isn't available to chat about drinks is when they are slammed with customers. Shame some people use yelp to say negative things for selfish reasons. I'll go back and I encourage you to do the same...GREAT bartender!","2013-10-18","0","oJsfjG1uh6jopK6Kc-3pdQ","AFW6jJWSsFP2N-3Ax4djnw"

When a tenant moves in, everything should be ready for that person to move in- but it was not. I let the keys go, but now I'm trying to move in and the condo is a mess.

"I had the Nom Nom, fries and a soda and paid $15.65.  The crinkle fries were good, and the Kobe beef dog had good flavor, but what really disappointed me was the standard out of the package bun, complete with hard dry ends. This completely ruined my meal.  A gourmet bun and\/or a steamer would be a huge improvement.  For the money, try pinks down the street. ( they don't steam their buns either) but the dogs have a great ""snap"" when you bight into them.

His response was sorry and the other place he used to work at had a different roll but didn't even offer to bring the correct or take it off the tab.  Everything tasted the same.

"Not a good experience. Came for dinner. While we were just seated in the regular dining area, the smoke from the Teppan grill was horrible. It lingered over us. It didn't seem to ventilate. We were seated at a table that was six inches from the wait station computer where the staff entered orders, congregated, argued, etc.   We ordered a dragon roll and nigiri. Sushi was okay. Chicken Katsu was nothing special. Wished they had a bento box or combo for dinner. We won't be back.","2013-07-19","0","gRMYm-CeEdjXtaQcVo8vsw","_uPEhW4TV2dSslkk6Yez-g"

The Goods: Friendly staff, great location, always clean around property as long as dog owners pick up their dog crap! Friendly neighbors, lots of kids but some are bad! Doggie areas with poop bags (we pay for it as a part of our high rent cost)

Not really a gated community since its open during business hours (any joe can just come in, unwanted friends or enemies). Gated community's are closed at all times.

"Not the best ""sports bar"" the decor was extremely minimal which did not give off a good bar atmosphere. The tables were left behind from the Italian resturant that was there before which again did not give off a bar feel.

Then I asked one of the girls who was obviously hanging with the waitresses about the drink specials. She was  totally blitzed, and said to me ""see your way out of the conversation"".

And oh yeah, for those who are inexperienced with the cuisine, if you're getting the pork soup dumplings, be very careful. There's hot soup inside. It's kind of like how you should approach a very hot cherry tomato.","2016-03-20","0","hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q","2lxvmWdCiDAjGPEzm0xkIw"

There's two entrances but only one hostess stand and no room to stand there waiting without hovering over nearby tables.

Amazing. So tasty and satisfying.  And for 8.99??  Wow. I'm hooked. Friendly service too.","2017-06-14","0","PgJLbJaCOqFXfh3OHsMPpA","5q50xosCgPi9VbsMZCs4mQ"

We have tried several dishes, including the incredible ""Sumerlicious"" menu; everything we have had from Fish & Chips, to Beef brisket on a brioche was delicious!  Try any of the ""shareables"" they are to die for - especially the Nachos!  The burgers are excellent and they better be; they are right next door  to ""Five Guys"".

I saw the waitress move toast on the plate with her bare hands - Wash Much?  The hash browns were good & my wife enjoyed her omelette.  Big problem with the crepes.  The crepes came from the kitchen burned on the edges.  To his credit the cook noticed me flaking off the burnt edges and offered to make us another crepe to go.","2013-05-11","0","OZC42gnhlJ_auXduDRfMoQ","ekm9VgXEk9i9qLdL_eUGaQ"

"What an unfortunate miss. With a concept and space that should be excellent, I can only give this place 2 stars. We ate there for breakfast and were the only ones there. Eggs were well cooked but the rest was not good. The ""salad"" that was 1\/3 of the plate was undressed, the ""hollandaise"" on the Benedict was solid (I mean not a sauce at all but a congealed ball of grease) and the sides if bacon for $2.50 consisted of 1 slice of bacon divided to cover the plate.

UPDATE: I did gel on both fingers and toes and my nails lasted about the same amount of time they would've if I'd gotten a gel mani at home but this was my first time doing gel on my toes and aside from my natural nail growth the polish lasted nearly a month!

"We didn't expect to be so disappointed. There was no bartender at all during their ""happy hour"" was odd, our waitress had to make us our drinks which took her 20 minutes. Our server had absolutely no knowledge of the menu. One of our group members ordered an appetizers as his meal- they were out but we weren't informed until half way through the meal. The server would disappear and not refill drinks. I would rather do take out then sit in there again.

"The dull white guy that took our order (happens to be the owner apparently) was undeniably rude the way he took our orders because my 3 year old son wanted his attention to order something. Next he tells us not to ring the small bell ever again (ever heard of saying pls?) and then he pretty much made two of our Chai extra light instead of extra strong! Shame how manners, ethics and hospitality is lost on some people. Must be a racist Trump supporting fan! He should learn some manners really!","2016-10-12","0","9yRS-SNzkfmThx2JJoilwA","5jVnqW7DiDaLL9_rImuoTQ"

Chris will sometimes scoff at me, and while I get the stress, I'm done being a whipping boy.  Great to bring a date or friend but probably the worst to meet anyone new.  I'm not sure if I'm coming back after tonight's beyond rude interaction.  Thanks for being nice to me when you were Chris.","2017-07-05","0","yZIbLgULM1I-wTri8r4IjQ","lDEyIcD1LNCfx1fuC9k-ag"

"Completely different from the first location. Chairs were too high, too hard and the tables too far and too low. You couldn't move either of them. Nearby tables had not been cleaned. It was as hot inside as it was outside. 4 different menu items were not available. The server gave me a stained little cup that was obviously just washed since it was wet. Reminds me of the carenderias in Cebu. I don't mind carenderias but if I'm paying $$ for this place, I expect more.

"Tip 1: Don't go here. EPIC FAIL on Amy & Mark(?) - the owners - do shady business. They don't honor the ""pay with cash and earn points towards a service."" 

Tip 2: If you choose to still go, don't voice a concern over the ""workmanship"" from their employees. You will be made to feel like it's your fault and feel inferior on future visits.

Tip 3: DO NOT GO. There are hundreds of other nail shops that do better work and  appreciate your business.","2015-04-09","0","mO8ukT3f5BRQ29pC_WoAtg","cRB1iYjUr7rPRGDdmhqkeA"

"If you order breakfast burritos -- which are HUGE; best food value around -- after traditional breakfast hours (I usually go just before midnight), make sure they understand what you ordered. The touchscreen just tells the cook you ordered a wrap -- which is technically true , but the last two times mine has been missing eggs and they didn't steam the tortilla.

The price may be higher than some other ranges, but the price includes all day shooting as well as targets, snacks sodas and a relaxing lounge area, show me another range that offers all of that for 20 bucks. The beauty is it is very quite and you don't have a ton of tourists like you do at the ranges by the strip.

"What a fun place!!! Service was excellent - Eddie was very personable and made great suggestions for our first visit there. He also checked in several times with helpful hints on getting the fish taco successfully in our mouths rather than slipping out the back end. 

Great videos playing on the flat screen of surfing and water fun history in Maui. The decor also makes you feel like you are in a super stylie beach cafe on the island.

There was no question as to which property I was talking to Kyle (leasing agent) about. Two hours later I get a text message from Kyle ; "" what property were you interested in""?  Long story short, Kyle dropped the ball. It was such a bad experience I emailed the CEO\/broker. My big question is; where do you find these  agents?

We had this hostess get our order and she didn't even write it down. Said that she is Amanda; looked like she belonged in college. Plus she reeked of smoke got our whole order wrong.

"I went in with very high expectations: the atmosphere was great. I purchased a mani-pedi for $35. The pedicure was super rushed. Lukewarm water, a hack job cuticle cutting that left me with an INFECTION in my big toe, and a really poor paint job, and all within the span of 10 minutes. I went over to the nail bar to get my hands done, and they were done within 6 minutes. They didn't seal the edges, the paint coats were uneven. And my manicure chipped within 2 days.

"My husband and i were Teharu fans until we found this place - Excited to have a sushi place closer to home! Some of the other negative reviews make this place sound scary, but after eating here we disagree - this place is awesome! Hip, clean, good food choices (that support gluten free eating!!), and cheap. They have 1$ - 3$ plates and the portion sizes are good.The only negative thing is that beer is more expensive here then at Teharu - it's 6$. Otherwise we recommend Ahi!! :)","2013-09-22","0","d7ozMWbBwcFOkHM3zmktfA","eYLZXq8_CkaEFtwta2zwHg"

Make sure you read the reviews on Angie's list too!

No coffee available and the 3rd couple to come in wanted biscuits and gravy that also wasn't available.  Debra our waitress was nice and apologetic. Please have what is on your menu available.","2013-07-07","0","fSb3blcWdJr2r3W4v210Ng","ThVvAv-gVqGXtOxG8PJUeA"

"This is my second visit to Sasa Sushi, I absolutely love their AYCE menu. The food is delicious and fresh. Although tip for all, if you get the waitress named Lacy, be prepared for terrible service. My food was ready & sat on the counter for 30 minutes and by the time she remembered it was there, it was already falling apart. Everyone I was with had their cups refilled w\/ their beverages and yet mine was neglected. I had to put my cup at the edge of the table for her to get the hint.

I got non stop compliments and her coming to my house to spray was the best thing ever! She's a total perfectionist and won't leave until your tan looks perfect (and that only takes her about 5 minutes!) no booth where you're suffocating and breathing in tanning spray, just super cute and trendy Dina making you look fabulous!","2013-04-26","0","u53gz-HlTfMoSSlMJlpPEg","UQBBrEz-Wm40R7a1tBVf7Q"
"I called Dina to come to my house, which is all the way in the city in shadyside, and she was more than accommodating. She showed up with her tent and product, set me up, made me feel very comfortable, and made it look so easy. I got a light tan, two layers. I was nervous because when I was spray tanned 4 years ago it was extremely streaky and got on every bra and piece of clothing. Not AT ALL the case with Brushed By Dina. I can't stop getting compliments and I'll never go in a cancer bed again","2013-05-01","0","u53gz-HlTfMoSSlMJlpPEg","s5E5DQ505eoYV2OZKfnvEA"

"Yummy authentic thai food with a nice customizable kick. Had the most amazing pad thai ( very fresh, clean and made to order) and the most amazing chicken wings.

Would definitely come back to try more food! Worth the trip! Way better than Thai Express, Salad King and Thai Basil.... Mmm this review is making me crave more thai curry food...

She never acknowledged any of our thank yous that we provided during our time and we had to remind her to get my drink from the bar. The other servers seemed rather attentive to their tables so maybe there is hope. The food runner was very polite and took our empty plates at the end as he noticed they were sitting there for some time. We had to ask her for our checks.

"Best spray tan I have ever had! I have had a ton of spray tans in my life, and this by far surpassed all of the others. Professional,organized, and customized. Incredible scents so the spray tan doesn't smell, shimmer to give it a flawless glow, and the powder to keep it from being sticky are the little things that make this the best place to go. Not only do you get all of the extra little things, but the price is perfect: $40. Seriously can't get any better than this.","2013-09-25","0","WQ1TU9rxjvY8oAgMaE5FwA","re0dReR4i7XFNC3zX5VwJQ"

"Great food and great beer. Nachos were among the best ever tasted. Perfect blend of spice and a touch of sweet. 1842 burger was amazing; caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms and truffle aioli were the perfect combo. Others had delicious fish and chips; very fresh with a light batter - literally melted in your mouth. Chef Michael Mina happened to be in the restaurant and was incredibly friendly and generous with his time. Pub 1842 is a must visit.","2013-06-28","0","YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA","NrRD9fpxEsCVBlfQ8PcpAg"

The chicken was tender, the rice was bland,  it was hard and old. Like it was sitting for a couple of days and I got the last of it. Disgusting! ! I told the young lady who took my order, she kindly went to the back got more rice on another paper plate and gave it to me, reminder:the old rice is still on my plate.

"I was on vacation in toronto and wanted to tried this place. I did not like this restaurant at all! Food was not good and the portion sides were very small. I'm originally from Peru and I was very disappointed. I ordered anticuchos and jalea. Anticuchos tasted ok but these were ridiculous small pieces for $10. The jalea had barely any seasoning and the picante lacked some salt. I live in florida and I'm used to eat a good portion size of food for less money. Only good thing was the pisco sour.","2014-05-11","0","WGmMEWmievG-DqD_Ix5KMg","RVAouE4Ok9biKCUAL6MgZA"

"My building has a 24\/7 concierge who is authorized to accept packages yet they still left a slip. Delivery guy probably  didn't want to move the heavy package. Gave them a call and the operator said they already tried delivering twice and if I wanted the item delivered again I'd have to pay them additionally. Complete BS because I was at home all day on both days and then there's the concierge. I'm letting them send the merchandise back to seller because I'm not gong to pay them a penny.","2016-09-12","0","G-pfJ45GejfgHTfGqi1kog","WtAHTXGq8verBAZMEYbVzA"

She the did the perfect light make up for my mom & gave me the dramatic Pakistani bridal look I wanted. She also stayed to help me put on my dress & veil and didnt leave until everything was perfect. She went above and beyond what any MUA would do. Overall, extremely happy with my make up.

"Not good!  Ordered Penne with Grilled Chicken.  Very saucy but even worse was the chicken that tasted like dry powder and several days old.  Wine and beer overpriced at $8 a glass and Corona at $4.50 each.  Also had Lasagna which was better but the sausage seemed as old as the chicken.  Only good thing was the garlic knots which came out fresh and hot.  Wish they had a little more fresh garlic on them though but still good.

"Horrendous.  When we called to ask if they could accommodate 10 people, they truly sounded like they didn't want our business.  We should have left it at that.

Appetizers came out after 30 minutes and dinner, an hour and 20 minutes after that.  If we didn't have such a large group, we would have walked out.  No reason for mediocre food to be that slow.

UPDATE:  husband was sick for three days after our dinner there.  Newspaper today shows sanitation score of 90.  Gross.","2013-09-28","0","ue1och-MuOytywoFUwBy_A","OgfUIRAFl4O83rIcIBUBKA"

It took a long time for our food to appear.   They're busy but not that busy.","2013-09-14","0","J_h3PRl7_6xmOy2C7dvs-Q","xiCI_DUbnA01p4x1FjmDVw"

"I've had trouble sleeping for years. Yadi worked with me & helped me when prescript meds and supplements couldn't. He worked on me and then gave me homework in order to get my chi back in order. He gave me exercises that made a difference, not only with my sleep but with my life in general. I can always tell when I don't do them...I  start having insomnia again. Yadi is patient & he explains everything and the philosophy behind it. Have an open mind and trust him to get your body back on track.","2013-08-10","0","hCAKE52GG4BGvXYS9vvVtw","TybIyvrphs4eFwIzTviuzg"

"This is authentic in style and more of a grocery store\/deli. If you want Americanized food and deli such as Aladdin's don't go. This is a very typical type of store in the Middle East . Have an open mind and explore the shelves and ask when items were made if not noted ie. bread delivery date. They will always say it's fresh so ask for a date.  Pre packaged foods are good and not Americanized so if they taste different it isn't because they are bad, it's because they are made right!","2017-10-07","0","3eYjYgsJxvRk7ULU9Lx4WA","M3Xml3p9zcqA6asZ9lJYOQ"

"Serving portions are small, so you can somewhat say it's overpriced. They didn't have sisig when we went, and it was within the first two weeks of opening. Our food came in at different times which is unacceptable in my opinion. Our server was ok. Based on my observation, it doesn't look like they were trained.

"out of mushroom and spinach. pizza gluten free really tasty banana peppers red peppers onion olives basil pesto and sauce topped  with shaved Parmesan was super yum. I asked for it a little well done so it would be crispy but to my dismay it was really burnt on the edges. Even with it being burnt was still super tasty up till the burnt edge so overall I'm happy with my experience. My hubby got one too his was a teeny bit burnt on edge as well. Staff super friendly and manager too. We will back!","2017-03-10","0","MGPdqitucDiq3T3gQWUXXA","ZcPOLkN5hh458As1qAuo7A"

Lobby  is a little small for the number of rooms and there is only one dining room. Food is decent but nothing special.  The staff is nice but there are too few of them. The village outside is cute.

Yesterday for a quick business lunch I decided to give this place another chance and again was disappointed 

The Ahi tuna salad was terrible, the tuna tasted cooked rather than properly seared and the dressing was bland. 

I guess the only reason you might wanna walk into a Cibo is to have drinks. 

I would never eat at any Cibo anymore!

"We heard negative things about this place since changing from ""The Strike Zone"" to ""Memo's"".  But, they were so WRONG!!!  The decor was bright w\/artistic photographs of Route 66.  Menu has a nice variety of American dishes along with ""daily specials"".  The server, Cheyenne, was very congenial & provided us with samples of  homemade Jambalaya & chili.  I went with the Jambalya (daily special) & my husband had the meat loaf.  We will definitely return for a light casual reasonably priced meal.","2014-04-03","0","Xb7jOAa17xtT_uA4sCCAsg","-sQEEUkAXwou6PxTg5zRTA"

"If you go in early on a weekend morning (when there are only 2 servers), sit on the left side of the restaurant. Both servers are very pleasant, but after many experiences with the one on the right, we grew frustrated with her seeming to be constantly overwhelmed. The one who works the left side is very much on-top of everything and never needs to be asked twice.","2014-06-01","0","v7In1lSZCIiku3o0yIXIRQ","NYGhZJbiV04XMzoHIOBSoA"

The fish pollock was not that great, (it felt sort of rubbery) and I was slightly disappointed upon finding that, for a case of extra bean dip, (don't get me wrong, the bean dip was very tasty) you must pay 1 dollar extra.

EACH dish was 9.95! I could go to congee wong and order a nice dish for 7.95 and its more tasty and id be full! Their seafood ramen is VERY watery and tasteless. Only one shrimp and some other crap.

"decided to visit pizza rock for a friend who was leaving town. I definitely wouldn't suggest going here in a large group. the waitresses were overly concerned with getting everyone in the groups alcohol order over our food order. after getting the ""New Yorker"" I can understand why. I was definitely not impressed. the declared award winning pizza was bland to say the least and certainly not worth the $23 dollars they charge. won't be coming back here again!","2015-10-24","0","3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ","KF4w73gJXI7PhrB9520mxA"

"Was in town for leasure and needed a quick touch up on my sides and back. I enjoy barbershops and this was a close one in the area. Although the guys are talented at what they do my experience was a little disheartening. I went in for a ""line up"" from what I understood was a clipper trim up that was listed for $12 on there website. At the end the total was $30.    Shocker. So just a heads up, it's cash only and no services or prices listed. Know what your getting into.","2016-12-13","0","lpfuJoqC_kGZcvk4diZkHw","l5_RgcWDVteIgrlWla8txw"

"This tip is for the management of the establishment, not the patrons. 

If your power goes out and you decide to comp meals, do it for everyone.

It is very disappointing that since you don't know how to use the old fashioned carbon imprints, you made a crayon rubbing of one patron's card and realized you don't want to deal with that anymore.  Comping everyone else was not fair and cost you a regular customer.","2017-07-10","0","7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg","wRpeMl9tXVx-EYAOagwj6w"

"They care 100% about their customers. They now carry their own juices which I have found to be better than any other products on the market. I would highly recommend this store to anyone who has tried to quit smoking or who is currently into vaping. Stop by and check out the store and see what they have to offer.  I also have been able to get family members to quit smoking and in fact no one in the family smokes any more because of the Vapery Storey. My Doctor is happy to see I no longer smoke.","2013-09-29","0","UcSM8_yD5YL_1mEcq8g4Iw","5dNLAB4EP60MmWE9c3425w"

Jay makes you feel right at home n is very helpful and informative n making the best decision for your vaping needs. The product is great quality for affordable prices and the juice is amazing!

Our family has gotten burned several times with rock  hard rice, brown lettuce and extremely salty pork (like they were trying to mask something). We're always enjoyed the afternoon service. They even let us order a few minutes before they opened. Extremely nice of them!  Oh, and the food was as delicious as we are used to.

"Do not go here! Run far from this place if you plan to get a weave. They probably braid very well but as for weaves, don't let them tell you they can do your weave or that it will look nice because the fact is they truly can't weave worth a damn! They have the nerve to call what they do a ""technique"". They will try to send you out of the shop looking like you let a blind 3 year old sew perfectly good hair in with yarn. You'll leave feeling like you got robbed. Look at the pics, it's a hot mess!","2016-04-30","0","F6WE0-RPzRKPrBcJYVmNCg","m47ZFm6kbiYMyPe6YzElLg"

"My 2nd poor experience. Our server was inattentive. Our wine was never decanted and we ended having to get up and pour our own. 1 person in our party ordered a steak and it came out at least 15 min after the rest of our party's meals. When it  was brought out it was way over done. They said sorry & offered to buy us drinks but by that time our meals were done. It was a very disappointing experience & after this I will not return and will be sure to not recommend this restaurant in the future.","2017-02-23","0","t6FCO31z5uYrCM26jCaIaA","vubmtzml_ozOpCQqmrE9VQ"

Shes extremely sweet and friendly oh and of course CREATIVE! I definitely recommend nostalgia resources for styling weddings, engagement, bridal, portrait, family, & lifestyle shoots in Las Vegas.

"Second time here and for sure my last. My first visit I was the second order in the window and it took 15 minutes for my sandwich. Today I was the 3rd in the window and it took 30 minutes. 30 MINUTES for a sandwich?! It's in a fast food court for petes sake. And my sandwich came out looking like a sloppy joe and wasn't even made how I asked. I ate it anyways in fear it would take another 30 to fix it. Now I'm suffering from a stomatch ache. Ps they eat while they work, sanitary? Never again!","2013-11-10","0","EaYGALPvXkv1_Kk5ZLpTgg","onzojC4KX1L1wYvrRRQDCA"

"Obviously very new; their own staff doesn't know their operating hours nor is it posted on the door. ""...until we run out of dough"" it says; cute but unreliable. Seven of us got off work at 10pm craving to try this pizza because I stopped by earlier this afternoon (2pm) to ask what time they closed and the guy kneading the dough said, ""11."" Jerk!!!

"Amazing staff! Super friendly. Really helpful with menu if your not too familiar with the toppings. The pizza taste amazing, it's garlicky and has just the right amount of crisp!

"I usually enjoy Burger King, pick up breakfast on Fridayl. Don't usually have problems at this location, but when your gut says check the bag before you leave, check your bag!!! Drove back to get two $1 items that were left. When I called told by Marie that she bagged the items, my response you may have bagged but it didn't make it to my vehicle. I get that it is fast food, but still have pride in your job and know that at the end of the day you did a good job!! Was told I was being offensive.","2017-10-20","0","6gxlDhmZ80bhflm2A-U0KQ","fKfTqgVIqVJe5qIsd0YSOA"

"The food used to be good, no longer I ordered pizza and wings. The sauce ordinary,a bit too much with hardly any cheese or sausage The sausage here used to be the only sausage I could eat in LV but it is not at all the same and is now just ok.Also got the mediumwings, they were plain just a hint of sauce  barely any meat on the tiny pigeon wings Palermo calls chicken wings...maybe an ounce of meat per wing. Very disappointing to eat at an old go to & discover it is not at all what it used to be","2016-05-16","0","LPMZ9N1sAjs2nDx7DmiZ2w","02Qbod85rFWE1xZrvUdu6w"

I don't believe that was the best it was very greasy . I also ordered a tostada and the tostada was probably the cheapest brand because it was thick and tasted disgusting ! The bean was plastered on to the tostada . Save ur money don't go to this place the only thing good was the horchata !","2013-11-21","0","sMIaQ79Kg7H6FKT41SULEA","c7e6JesWIxMe7Pd8YDb8ag"

"I had an amazing reflexology treatment with Susan. So  booked a facial next day with Jean. Jean was like a butcher. I left with a bleeding eyebrow after 20 minutes. Susan said the 'red' would be gone in a couple of days. Red? It was bleeding where she had stuck pins in a white head to ""extract"". Cruel and unusual punishment. I took a photo. I wish I could post it somewhere.  Painful. I left in a hurry because I felt uncomfortable and unsafe.","2015-08-23","0","nQxeoUAFlCDj63xHVIMstw","Xgcua4BH40RPNC8aBF4yJA"

"Went to happy hour with a group of teacher friends on Friday. Seating was very limited, we felt like we were seated in the lobby of a small hotel! The bartender seemed less than happy to accommodate us especially because we asked for separate checks, before we ordered. H.H. Food was fine but microscopic in size. The gin and tonic I ordered was good but who messes that up? All in all I probably won't be back as we didn't feel very welcome.","2017-05-13","0","igHYkXZMLAc9UdV5VnR_AA","s_Bj02n-ZtNVM89C_89RdQ"

"This place is in close proximity of my house so it's nice to be able to walk over and have a beer. But this places has sub-par food that is way over priced for the quality & what you get. The bartenders are a bit preoccupied with their friends or regulars that the rest of us have to wait up to 40 minutes for another drink.

"This is a great gym, especially if your new to fitness or coming off a long layoff. Yes the weights don't go as heavy as more standard gyms which would be my only gripe; However, thats a smarter way to train if you're just starting out or making a comeback. Slow progress is the best progress when it comes to fitness. It allows your body time to adjust to training. And with a calmer and less intense atmosphere that helps you to focus on simply improving.","2016-07-11","0","4DtjA7EoxUSyWiXEuElPVA","00KBvm45X3IJosDyEgsVDA"

That's how long until the tenant turning the oven on. We had them turn it on (the stove) in the store they ""said"" it was in great shape and had already tested it. Now we are out to by ANOTHER one. Should've just bought new from a big box and should've listened to all the reviews on here to begin with.","2014-09-15","0","fEUdLI6xlbDu4JqUDyFYIA","HVcrBIoDmoIbfQh4Mlb7VQ"

"I have been shopping here for several years because you could usually find a designer item in excellent condition for a reasonable price. But the last few years I have noticed  that the quality is no longer there. Their clothing is old, worn out, dirty, torn and buttons or zippers broken. I guess buyer beware when you shop there. Also, many items are not designer anymore....you will even see clothing from Costco, H&M, Target, etc. I would rather buy new for the non-designer items.","2015-12-19","0","NOtdhHE4oTaODsJgW8GXPA","iN0u63tMoLI71VT5sTeJUA"

They promise the world when you move in and than literally do nothing when you have a legit complaint. Maintenance was on point!","2016-11-26","0","6kIs9mkP9Rx72nkJraz7yg","NiAoFCy4T_bVgwoFhrxK-A"

"11\/26 @ 6pm. I was trapped in the drive thru for 50 min. I was really excited to try a new spot, now I really wish I hadn't. When i got to the window i had to order as the ""batteries ran out"" at order screen.  Still same guy with a yellow cap and no hair net, none of the ladies handling food had hairnets, although the drive thru technician did. Overall disappointing experience. The owner needs to make some major adjustments if any return customers are desired! At this rate they will be shut down","2013-11-26","0","TAEMcgLcCLebzn8Jd3nVRw","aKAQ4zQtyE__kAw0uAHsQg"

They definitely didn't hold back on the cheese. I can't stand when you order a pizza and there's hardly any cheese. The flavor of the pizza was just as great. I was shocked when I got on yelp and saw the bad reviews. Maybe it was cuz they were still just opening? Very happy with the food and customer service, top notch.

"Poor customer service.  Today we experienced a ""manager"" (term used very loosely), make us feel that it was our fault for not being aware of their non-substitution policy for veggies.  Very odd situation because as we pointed out that their employee who took the order did not mention an up-charge for substitutions they were not apologetic in any way.  Refused to refund the difference.

"Food was good however very very slow service. Small restaurant. Our order was put in wrong and we were brought a wrong waffle and also our side of toast was forgotten. Not sure if I would recommend this place or come back again. Also, they do not validate parking (only 3$ but still)","2013-12-15","0","ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg","SkZ-zZwAvdqNoY9DtA1XXw"

After a NIGHTMARE scenario the day of my wedding on 12\/10\/2016, I had to fire Mirage Limousines due to fraudulent acts of changing all the terms of what we agreed to (including the time they would pick me up from our wedding reception, the type of car, and the cost). I called Saba Limo just an hour before the ceremony began in desperation to get a ride scheduled for later that evening for my wife and I to our hotel. They came through in the clutch!!!

"Amazing. Started with the miso soup and house salad. Also chose the chili garlic edamame as an appetizer. For our sushi roll, we selected the Desert Sunset Roll- (Shrimp Tempura, Crab Mix, and Cucumber, topped with Yellowtail, Avocado, and Ponzu Aioli). Incredible. The highlight of the meal had to be the  Spicy Crispy Chicken. Phenomenal. If you're looking for a laid-back, casual spot with fantastic food, Bei will not disappoint!","2014-04-23","0","yqYtY3-Po4OVPafA9Z-Xyw","nQrb8ZJtsWy5XkhPvUpL_g"

"Greetings!!
I visited this restaurant and it's really good one!!
I found myself eating food (kibdah and ma'soub) just like the ones in my hometown, Makkah, I really enjoyed the food and their prices are very reasonable and affordable.
I advise everyone to go there. Even you are Muslim or not you will enjoy decent fresh food.
One last thing, authenticy guaranteed because the owners who make the recipe are Saudis from AlMadinah Almonorah, so they definitely know how to prepare our special food.","2013-10-22","0","5MxHxh4O5BgpQuuPBElvWg","veOKqGFt2HQgYf-H2-OP-A"

"I ordered Arabic food, which had hair in it. This means that they don't have control over their cleanness in the kitchen. The restaurant's service is always bad all week round.

The fries were also re-cooked. We had two glasses of wine and a beer and the total of all three drinks was $29. A little pricey for a sports bar in Pittsburgh if you ask me.

"Sad to see it local restaurant closed. Both my son and I like their risotto locale but considering the price , it seem small portion wise.  
Whatever you order , there going to. W long wait cause only 1 Chef in the kitchen.  So if you need to rush , don't go as service is slow. We usually hang out there on Friday lunch.

"My favourite lunch spot. Thai Kitchen somehow manage to offer fresh and delicious Thai dishes between £3 - £5 . and they are always friendly. I entered their kitchen a couple of months ago when they were relatively new and have by now become a regular and enjoy spevial treatment... but they are genuinely nice. 
After a little smalltalk the chef asked what my favourite Thai dish was. Since then they make it for me and i come twice a week and enjoy my favourite soup!!","2014-02-27","0","xHqiJVK2gFMyZi7-zAYbzw","p4B4hO_QkkkHsdPkshXYAQ"

"One tip is that the waitstaff seem to get busy and disappear for long periods of time in the kitchen. It can take some time for the server to recognize that you're finished eating and bring you the bill. If you're in a rush it can be a waste of time to wait to flag them down. I don't bother waiting for the bill and I just walk to the cash register at the front when I'm done.

"The front desk was polite and friendly upon check in.  The room (438) was enormous for a hotel room.   Unfortunately it also smells like an ashtray.    Upon trying to switch rooms, I learned the hotel is a sell out, so they quickly offered an ionizer for the room while I was out.    It's in the bedding, the leather headboard, the pillows.   I've never experienced such an overpowering stench of stale cigarettes.  The toilet is filthy, as well.

"Stopped here last evening after the Stevie Nicks concert and ordered a couple ""late lunch"" dishes. The truffle fries were very good- not greasy but plenty of flavor from the truffle oil and Parmesan cheese. A giant meatball was our second choice - also very tasty and well flavored. Really enjoyed the ambiance and although our waitress was attentive, other staff seems a. It fliers as they cleaned around us and opened a big door which blew a tiny dryad in right on us.","2017-04-01","0","wY3dlpLa0BHfDENYAPYuZA","ivSyr1a8Z4L9v0sgzMOuZw"

""I went there a couple of weekends ago with a friend to order some late night snacks and drinks. We arrived around 11pm and to our surprise the bar was packed. We happened to get seated right away but didn't enjoy the 20 min wait for service. Countless waitresses just kept walking past our table without coming to see if we have been helped. It was only when my friend went back up to the hostess to complain did they realize. At that time the hostess was nice enough to walk over..","2014-09-20","0","ID7WUBLnhkdxp8QrjsssZg","df9Oy09pIc6MZGB1qel0YQ"

"Even though it's outdoor seating thy aren't pet friendly. My guy got to stay because he is a service dog for my PTSD but before asking if he's a service dog they just told us to leave which is against the law according to the American disabilities act. They should first ask if he is a service dog and if I say yes thy can only ask what service he provides instead of kicking us out. Kind of rude and against the law.

We mentioned that our drinks tasted ""off"" many times before the bartender realized the soda was not operating properly, no compensation or corrective actions were made.

"Whatever you do don't critique their marketing campaign.  Not sure what image they are trying to create but when I mentioned it didn't make me want to visit their bar, one of their employees directed fans of the page to start visiting my page and comment on my pics. 
Nice strategy. 
Lots of options in this city for places to go, and if you don't want pictures of guys with food dribble down their faces and a nice dose of Internet harassment, im sure anywhere but here will be just perfect.","2014-01-02","0","GQSmxqRi_s9U9qd5gHLKAw","K8-xQpmiZNxeF9a3VsBGnQ"

"Dr. Vu and the staff are so nice! They're always willing to answer all my questions and concerns. Be sure to call ahead because there is a walk in and cancellation fee. Which is understandable because the schedule needs to be balanced to ensure the quality of care to all the patients. I wouldn't want someone to just walk into my office\/job at anytime and demand services. It's just proper etiquette to call ahead. And if it's urgent there are, urgent care clinics & the emergency room for a reason.","2014-05-09","0","1_iibQxnp0WhQH2m7kXtng","oQa5irnvpnMdVDF7sPYvxQ"

And at one of the turnouts your have the choice to take an unmaintained road..... we took it for like a quarter mile before we decided we did NOT want to risk popping our tires so we did u turn to get back (it's literally a gravel road). But overall, if you want to explore something outside of Vegas, come here :) don't forget to check out the visitor center first because the scenic tour exits you completely out of the area.","2013-08-02","0","odyYR1Bg2bqmp1kVlm8OYw","bVA6dAMy-bc9KTFbEOCSyQ"

"I took my mom here for Mother's Day to get her lashes done and now she's hooked like me! She went with a sweetheart for a more natural look while I went with the rock star look. My lashes tend to stay on for about 4 weeks before I see them start to thin out. The staff and the owner Dan are all very nice making you feel very welcome. They also give you a big comfy blanket to go along with the awesome chairs!

To feel good and healthy while still enjoying my food to the fullest.  That salad is gone.  The chicken patties and the burgers have gotten noticeably smaller, and they changed the cheddar cheese they were using on the burger giving it a completely different taste.  Smh :-(

I usually agree with reviews on yelp and my husband and I were very excited to try a new pizza place, but service was SUPER slow, my calzone was tasteless, and our waiter while kinda cute\/gumpy\/awkward was terrible. Sad, because we really wanted to like it!","2014-02-01","1","LymQXYNAomFUGOA-4llkhQ","11DgfAZkq3CPPB9lDcw7mQ"
