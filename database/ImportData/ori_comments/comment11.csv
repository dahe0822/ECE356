"OK peeps, you must try the chicken parm entree and the chicken parm sandwich (sandwich not on menu, but ask).  I do not think you will be disappointed.  The marinara isn't sweet or acidic or spicy for this item, perfectly compliments the provolone cheese and perfectly cooked chicken breast. As a regular I have tried many many things on Kendra's menu...this my new fav and highly recommend...","2013-08-15","0","3CBLxydJU6CFRMGhu9b-sw","JE2-SsoGJXuJmJEWdbUGrA"

"I was referred to Dr. Arooni by my girlfriend a couple months ago. Dr. Arooni and Amanda are my favorite combo at Dr. A's office. I recently had all 4 wisdom teeth removed and the all I have to say is, what pain? Dr.  A removed all 4 in no longer than 10 minutes and all I felt was a little pressure. I recovered in about 3-5 days and didn't even need my medication that I was prescribed. While I was getting my teeth removed my hands were bathing in the complimentary paraffin wax :)","2013-05-13","0","dUsIHBszO8QuBtlZhS8RfA","YTx9W9aBsIs6Jv77DSYUpQ"

"I called in this morning about a specific tire and a gentleman named Orlando Saucedo helped me with my situation. He found my desired tire within seconds and scheduled me down for an appointment for service. I was in and out with a new set of tires within 20minutes. I am astonished with the customer service and the timely manner in which the work was done. Orlando is a shining star at discount.","2013-05-13","0","vPeecqZ7RQWbuO238WazTA","YTx9W9aBsIs6Jv77DSYUpQ"

"To start. This place was freezing, after moving tables away from the door to escape the cold, we waited 40 mins to get one single sushi roll. 20 mins later we got the rest of our sushi rolls. When they arrived to the table, they were the worst sushi rolls. I believe food poisoning is in my future.","2012-12-28","0","PuB-oSX_fMh0822kChScrA","-DJNpdIl1vRcS7PksWll5w"

The Asahi beer was ice cold, and the hot saki was nice and hot. The chef was very generous as he sent out two pieces of seared salmon nagiri with a mango salsa for my table to try. It was flavorful and very light, great for summer in AZ.  Music of all generas played n background. Rating awesome must try this place.

"I love the facial, the chocolate body wrap,anton is great and so is jordan. the one who did my mani pedi looked like she was in a hurry didn't talk, didn't treat me like how the others treated their customer, hence I forgot her name.  The one who did my hair wasn't careful,  she kept hitting my head with the brush and blower so I forgot her name too.  I'll go back for a massage hopefully I get anton again.","2014-10-09","0","xpocpPlEWaQygGMLSvjelQ","5HMpvEPzG0rj-uOrzmch5A"

"Went to Wanda's this morning only to be greeted at the side walk telling us to leave or put our drinks in the car because they don't like outside drinks. Do you want my business or not? Having a Starbucks drink is no reason to tell a customer to leave. Well I did leave and won't be back, I will also tell 10 friends. You can't operate a business like that Wanda, sorry but you just lost at least 10 customers.","2013-03-17","0","e5maG90XWT2pYqkfbxIdIQ","Ohi5KohlrvbqlUa9ALD-4A"

I asked for extra salsa and added the hot to it was mixing it up and found a piece of chip in it. Asked the server if they keep chips by salsa she said no. So either employees are eating chips and salsas out of what they serve customers or they pure the old stuff off tables back in. Either way that's sick and wrong.

"Kudos to Chaz and Libby. They were kind when we asked for special privileges tonight. came in with my 96-year-old father. It was a 30 minute wait for the patio (quieter) They allowed us to sit and wait for when we could get a server. Chaz, one of the managers, proceeded to take an order for us. they were kind, compassionate...the food was the usual great dinner.

Thank you!!!! To the Keg staff! Our father does not ""look"" any where near his age, but in the last year he has become quite feeble.","2014-03-24","0","sQV-yfhFjeRWnHw66n8qrQ","powMTrLSqhFFpmZr-1ekEA"

Mold remediation, they said. There was a spot of mildew where the water heater was, they did NOT open any walls to verify if indeed there was mold, which there was not.

"WARNING PLEASE READ:  They used the McKensie method, pushing and insisting that I bend backwards. Problem is you can't push bulging and herniated discs back in you just pinch them causing herniation, as confirmed by 3 other doctors, including my neurosurgeon!

"Ok so first time at this location and I ordered pizza muffins and a salad.  The salad came and as I started to cut the peelings off my cucumber slices a tiny spider ran up my thumb..holy crap!  Then when the muffins came they were not done, dough was raw inside and the mushrooms I asked for smelled old..everytime I have ever been to the Alma School location the food and service has been superb not the case at the Gilbert location. I won't go back there. The server was good not her fault.","2013-07-06","0","aCkAmpBmEJCeRBJ5_Q2D-Q","sGyUt0QAVhPyH44u-V0fyw"

Con- can't see a lot of stuff on top of clothing racks.  The salespeople were awful!  I brought in a lot of stuff to sell and they never greeted or acknowledged me. Then I asked if they had batteries (apparently mine died in a bouncer somewhere between home and the store) they said yes. Took out a small drawer and put it on the farthest part of the counter from me.  They refused to take a great bouncer seat, but a customer in the store offered to buy it anyway.","2013-08-25","0","OC3PUomMpn_QisIM1H-7Wg","w9HYH0ENf49ayyi6EXxPUg"

WARNING Their employees have not heard of Spaghetti Bolognese So you have to order it as spaghetti with meat sauce or you'll get lasagna. Kind of silly but can cause a LOT of difficulty. 

The service can be hit or miss. I got eyes rolled at me from the manager working for the spaghetti \/ lasagna mixup.  Longer story required but basically he made me feel very uncomfortable for their mistake.","2013-06-24","0","g_x5lM7itVvWA9n34QVlFA","kqYMFocDA4ERNB3OerPJuA"

Love this restaurant, not gonna lie! But not sure if I'll visit on a Saturday night again. I've been here about 15 times and it's the loudest I've ever experienced!

"I was happy with the dish I had!  The chile relleno was delicious as well as the pork tamale! The salsa was okay but not great.  I was confused at the menu of why they would serve so many fish dishes?  If its considered a new Mexican cuisine. The server was horrendous not very knowledgeable about the menu. Never came back to refill water or order another beer.  The food was good enough to give it another shot I hope the service will be better.","2013-05-25","0","BgQ5ob0QiZfO5YbgI7VyFw","DwUybsWia_Imktay1uoaMg"

"The Dog treats ( not even joking) must have crack in them. My dog is a very well behaved (never does anything to be shamed for) actually broke in to the cabinet and ripped into the can to get these treats. ""So weird"". We had to move the treats and banish him to the back yard for a time out ""actually he banished himself"". It broke my heart. He was hilarious.

Pack up your friends and make a night of it. You should plan a couple of hours  this is a social place not a fast food joint.

I looked at the smokers in the back and they looked pretty fancy. The atmosphere was good for Gilbert Az but not for west Texas. If I can't see smoke and eat off butchers paper then it ain't real BBQ in my book. This place gets 3 stars outta 5.

"My new old go to place for comfort food in a warm ambiance get there before  7 to sit at the bar fridays it is packed, The smoked salmon is delicious as is the artichoke  and the fries * do note  that the artichokes are subject to availability* this means they will not serve an artichoke if the crop is bad best to call ahead and inquire if you would like to have this. Service is always attentive and drinks are potent","2017-03-11","0","zrDi4gEaUi64lAMfJU51dw","2aI-PmFX82U50ToNmS0O4Q"

"Nice happy hr menu, but careful where you sit. Apparently some of the seats are reserved for hostess seating only, didn't know bars had rules like that. After being told to seat ourselves in the bar we were lectured by our waitress that we sat in a hostess setting area, ( in the bar) but since it wasn't busy, we could stay. She just wanted us to know for future reference. My husband & I felt awkwardly  uncomfortable the whole time after that.

"The owner Eddie is a cheap-ass. Checked in on OpenTable and he, yes the owner,  refused to check us in because he said it would cost him $1. Our bill was $76.76 including an added 20% tip. No wonder why this place is losing business on top of it I am the Duke, unfortunately at this establishment. Eddie this is why you're losing your business. Take yourself off of Open Table if you're not going to honor their policies. Really a $1.","2016-08-10","1","orMlHMLyHSldYgzfFTaeoA","KxGeqg5ccByhaZfQRI4Nnw"

"Serious cleanliness and maintenance issues here. Locker rooms are dirty, they're so lazy, rather than fixing soap dispensers, they put out a dirty industrial bottle of soap with a broken pump spout. Sauna benches have loose boards. Have you guys heard of nails?! It takes two seconds.  That said, I still like this gym, even though it is overcrowded.

"If you purchase a Groupon, you can't call and make an appointment with just any stylist. You have to call the number listed on the Groupon. It's specific to one stylist and goes direct to her cell. I see one person is unsatisfied because they probably called the wrong number. I certainly wouldn't want to hear someone ramble about a Groupon if I didn't accept them. Duh. Not all salons accept payments on behalf of the stylists......they pay booth rent and set their own prices. Welcome.","2015-03-29","0","sIZo0oZJNscmSC7s6bKuXA","rTP_xCgLW691is5U9Pw3OA"

"WoW! Did I step back into the 1980's? I have to give them 5 stars or at least maybe 10 stars on the decor. The people working here are so freaking friendly and awesome! The subs are okay well in the 1980's this is how food tasted and it's a trip back in time before we had other things to snack on. This is my favorite place. Also on a note. The sandwich is bland and the bread is mediocre. Overall it tastes like it's from the '80's. Maybe think of using Boars Head meats instead of cheap quality.","2014-06-03","0","GQaOgUdJOVoEzMaKODD8Hg","ocAUlzNwEUkkPPoxJ9-wVA"

"I wish equity still owned this place. There is always garbage all over the grounds. Including this lovely needle that was laying around on the sidewalk for at least a week. 
Management there is also terrible. When you're moving in they're awesome. But if anything else happens don't expect help. 
After 4 years of living there I have moved out and can honestly say that they have the worst staff of anywhere I've ever lived.","2014-03-29","0","0QMJ4VlRSYYd-eDZpVjxKw","PaJ9e4Q0Wao-CdRwzEOgDQ"

"Called on Friday night to see if I came in around 10 pm would a table be open for myself and my fiancé   He said they close at 10. I told him the website says 11 pm  he then said oh no that's only sat. So I called the chandler location to see if they were open late. They told me the scottsdale one is open till 11 on Fridays.

"Beware! Better get a full quote before you hand these crooks your keys. Went in for simple truck alignment, usually 50 - 80 bucks anywhere. Place up the street had a deal for 49.95 I found out later. To my surprise it was 109.95 for an alignment at this place when I picked it up!!!! Shame on me for not asking. Don't make the same mistake out of convenience. Go somewhere else!!!! Being in Scottsdale is no reason why you should over pay.","2013-07-18","0","0X3P9USnJofwVkM_bCc2Bw","G9ZtEbVkJ5r0uxwBKFlQLg"

"For just over eight bucks I got a half pepperoni half Hawaiian on the original style crust . I went home skeptical that I could make a good pizza in a conventional oven. I cooked for 10 min on the prepanned then cooked for a remaining 8 minutes by switching to a pizza stone. I popped it on the counter and cut it into right hearty pieces. Let it cool for 3 mins. First bite I was blown away it was excellent, super  cheesy and the crust was crunch and dowey.  I am a fan I highly recommend.","2013-08-01","0","CsdDwluwDz6NpiSx3QfToA","BArjH2vHo5adQcjAWi_2_A"

"My husband and I have had a plesant experience living here at Ventana. We are in an A1 unit.

Positives: Great storage space, family friendly, close to walking trails and Safeway, quiet, dog friendly, and we are so blessed to have such great neighbors. 

Negatives: Some people are too lazy to clean up after their pets (dog poo under pet clean up stations). When we moved in our carpet was crunchy and had stains, but it was a time where new management was coming in. 

Overall, great experience.","2014-04-05","0","E-rDOTVdGv5HtAZiPR_jnw","fCdgflaW8JOYWRrkxLovUA"
"This complex has spacious-sized apartments with lots of room for storage, and a fair amount of guest parking. The downside is these apartments are rapidly-aging units with old, creaky appliances, and cheap single-pane windows. Management is typically apathetic to complaints\/problems, and anyone with any concept of high standards will probably not enjoy living there.","2015-08-29","0","E-rDOTVdGv5HtAZiPR_jnw","IjKdFfxOWW1EHQQlqXsAVw"

"Terrible food quality.... Repeatedly.  Chicken mcnuggets where rubber and inedible.  Honestly, you can tell if food is hot while you're putting it into the bag.  Serving cold food is ignorant and shows an overall sense of apathy towards your customers.

"Good sushi. Nice intimate atmosphere. Unfortunately, they appear to be easily overwhelmed and service suffers. Wait staff needs to be more attentive and alert. 

Happy hours Sunday - Thursday,  5 pm - 6 pm.

Tried this place again. Totally disappointment. Service was horrible. I had to go to the bar to get drink service. It took us 3 requests to finally get the check. 

While the sushi was good, the overall experience was totally disappointing.

They pile the meat high. Since the most expensive sandwich is $5.75 w\/tax they're a GREAT DEAL! Think of what it would cost for triple meat at subway.

This was the best mistake I've ever had. I want to name this sandwich a Dirty Acapulco. PLEASE put it on the menu.","2014-03-23","0","3JnO3AEqRD8DbXkWP-gTFw","W0DJOPsSwcAj0uqCJG8iLw"

"I would hold off on going until next week or so when they are executing the new menu due to their new chef. We were in LOVE with former chef and menu so fingers crossed it is just as good now.

We went on 4\/13 and there was just a temporary menu that was so boring we left and went somewhere else...no pork bellies, no ahi, etc. We will be back in a few to check out new menu.

Hope manager understands that his  regular clientele are foodies and not snowbirds who want basic meat and potatoes.","2016-04-15","0","fef0DIGxNDY0vKM027sgCg","lHzMn11Kj9vrspbO72y2Vw"

Very good crab and shrimp, fire roasted in a big covered pan with potatoes and corn on the cob. We upsized a steamer bowl to a two person serving, a little too much food for us in fact. Dang good, very nicely done. We are going to make this one of our bi-monthly must haves. Give it a shot!","2014-08-03","0","iPyhXWQ2LVSgBlQA4vqKJw","6PGyx1QKACuwd5C1zrooTw"

Be respectful of your neighbors. Be aware of city noise ordinances,control and pick up after your pets and yourself.
