"I was about to eat here, not knowing about the prices here and wasn't expecting to see such a price jump from the usual pho prices. So my group and I kindly let the restaurant lady know we changed our minds before she even provided any service, in which she gives us such bitter and rude insults, saying that we were stupid for not eating there. Her words: if you go to other places to eat, it would be smart to eat here, but I guess you're not that smart. 

Ok thanks bye.","2016-01-02","2","m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng","3iVGRQ8l5TV_kiEUOJicsw"

To top off this poor experience we found a clear hard piece of plasticky thing in our cake.  Told the manager all she said was oh it's from one of the cleaning scrubs as if it was no big deal.

"Bar none, they broke the bar and threw it away! Amazing amazing upscale burger experience. Was recommended by attendant Robin to try the wild boar burger and it exceeded expectations! Service was superb! The food left me wanting more even though I couldn't finish!! My girlfriend had the lamb burger and it was so delicious too. We ended up sitting next to bona fide food critics, incredible people! We strike up conversation over wine, sample desserts and we are done!

The park decided to change the line system. Before this change , when you got in line, you would be on the stairs and move a few stairs at a time which was super easy. The fact that ALL of the stairs are shaded and have a misting system to keep you cool was great. I couldn't help but think "" wow they've thought of everything!""

"the line system had changed. Now you are expected to wait behind ropes at the BOTTOM of the stairs! No misting system to keep you cool! After about 35-45 minutes waiting, when it is finally your turn you are told that you have to climb ALL 8+ flights of stairs at once! That's completely insane! Especially in the AZ heat! Plus while you are in line at the bottom, if you need to leave the line to get water ( which is inevitable ) you and your group have to go back to the end of the line!","2013-08-08","0","BpqggO7klU9Ky6WnVin1rg","f6OoHlzWcuMSdfY2Qa2t7w"
"Loved this water park, bought season tickets for my entire family and we had a blast, that is until the last visit. 
The park decided to change the line system. Before this change , when you got in line, you would be on the stairs and move a few stairs at a time which was super easy. The fact that ALL of the stairs are shaded and have a misting system to keep you cool was great. I couldn't help but think "" wow they've thought of everything!"" 
However on our last visit","2013-08-08","0","BpqggO7klU9Ky6WnVin1rg","f6OoHlzWcuMSdfY2Qa2t7w"
"I had to rush my 7 year old to the dr!!! 
I have called 3 times and left messages asking to get a refund on my season passes, and no one has called me back!
I am a mother of 5 daughters, so the $200.00 plus I spent I. These season passes could go to something we will actually use!
I will NEVER return to wet n wild, which is so sad, because we looked forward to our Thursday trips  ( my girlfriend went everyday of the week as well)","2013-08-08","0","BpqggO7klU9Ky6WnVin1rg","f6OoHlzWcuMSdfY2Qa2t7w"
"Don't want to spend an arm and a leg on food in the park? Wet n Wild specifically disallows customers to bring food into the park *unless* you have health reasons to need special food. We packed a bunch of sandwiches and planned on telling the front security people we had diabetes. Well, we didn't even have to because they didn't care about the food. Moral of the story, bring your food with you!!","2014-09-03","0","BpqggO7klU9Ky6WnVin1rg","qQA8OI-OBt8_fGULsZMLFA"

"I was looking forward to relaxing in the lazy river all summer! As an adult that is one of the few attractions to make it fun\/relaxing. Unfortunately they turned the lazy river into a kids Attraction where you get buckets of water dumped on your head every few feet and kids can stand on side lines and shoot you in the face with high powered squirt guns. So disappointing!!! One bonus is the bar. Saving grace to at least be able to drink cold beer while the kids go wild!","2015-06-02","0","BpqggO7klU9Ky6WnVin1rg","NpHj5E2qkX9DS4jbXf-s6A"

We waited. And we waited some more. After a full 10 to 15 minutes of being completely ignored we got up and left.

"Saw this place on the way to my gate and decided to grab lunch. Picked the pulled pork sandwich. What arrived was a heaping mound of pulled pork on a bun with coleslaw and pickles. Meat was cooked perfect in a slightly sweet mustard BBQ sauce with a little hint of heat. Coleslaw was had just the right balance of sweet and sour. Pickles added another layer of flavor and tartness. A bit messy to eat but worth it!","2013-09-05","0","iRhB506lbc0kU5289zyHzg","25bLJNcNRqJzTGFHkkBb5g"

"Empanadas were good but for the size (a little too small for me) and the price ($8 for only four) definitively not a good deal. My daughter ordered the kids meal (chicken tenders and fries) but the fries were way to over seasoned. My wife ordered the ribeye with roasted potatoes. Everything tasted good but she had the impression that the potatoes were at least a day old....finally, our waiter was very nice but the service was very slow....I don't think we will be coming back any time soon.","2013-06-28","0","wc2u2JM4Fx2smNwuIYxDzg","1im4d6E7N9arAiYIjOAnqA"

While the patty itself was cooked as I like it and it was tasty, they skimped on the cheese and though the bun looked toasted, it was COLD!  I took two bites and then proceeded to just eat the fries. My meal wasn't bad...but it wasn't good. I then understood why the place was barely half full on a Friday night while the place directly across the street was jam packed with a 40 minute wait.","2016-12-05","0","Uvq6V0G784vJzYFjLddIgg","nR-HEujwEre8Cxe0mBeShg"

"Not going back. This is not the first time that they give me my sandwich with barely anything in it. Not only are they stingy with their meat, they are also stingy with their vegetables. They pinch a few out of their container and place them exactly in the middle without even spreading them out throughout the sandwich. I always have to open my sandwich up and spread them out myself. The employees are also very dull and the store is just lifeless.","2016-04-28","0","AS0DHJWaQTw2C6M1u6nuuA","S97de-ZHFnsgpJhsC1dnwA"

"Disappointing for us. Our baby wasn't in a good position which I understand, but the 2D pictures were good and I kept asking the technician to take a 2D picture and she wouldn't listen to me.

"I wanted some pink in my hair and went here. I've gone here many times before. Johnny is the one who died my hair. He was very rude since I sat in his chair. He had a horrible attitude (as he always does) and he was VERY rough while brushing my hair. My hair is dark so it needed to be bleached. Long story short... My hair was over processed and 8 INCHES MELTED OFF!!!!! Did he say sorry? NOPE. Instead he kept trying to blame me and blame whatever hair products I used.

Don't let this fool you. Silverware was dirty- food was bland and not fresh at all.

"To pay for ferry rides, the right-most lines go faster (cash-only) and tend to be more single-file (versus the mob of people in the middle lines that eventually need to separate). 

Also, once ticket is paid and you're in the boat waiting area, go to the left side of the line for Centre Island.  The right side of the line has many people trying to join in.  But there are gates that funnel people straight for gate 2, and it all converges left of the green post.

I got a bill for over $500 .$200 for carpet cleaning and carpet dye and $175 for cleaning fee for a 2 bed apartment which I cleaned before I left.. I pay $100 to have my 4 bedroom house cleaned now.. this company needs to go.I truly hope that EGW investments reads these and sees what Tipton group is doing to their facility..

For $3 my only complaint is that the cup is very small, only because I want more of this magical drink! My friend got a mocha and they nailed the balance of the sweetness. Perfect. The barista is not very friendly but she's getting the job done and I'm not complaining.

"Extremely disappointing. The food was not good. This is why: bisquits were STALE and hard and they use corn beef hash instead of sausage in the gravy which just tastes awful. The bread is cheap wonder bread that u like they get it from the dollar store. It comes out without butter and you do it yourself except the bread is already cold so it's terrible. The hash browns were missing the ""brown"". The coffee is AWFUL! The pancake was ok. Probably bisquik.

"I really enjoyed this tour, I am definitely sensitive to the paranormal, so I figured why not go and see if anything happens! We got pictures of orbs, the creepiest one we captured was at the exact spot where this guy hung himself. Also Liberace's place was the most haunted, definitely felt a presence there. When i went in the back room, my rods moved in the direction I asked each time. The only negative thing about the tour was that the tour guide seemed to be in a huge rush.","2013-04-23","0","fiinXBUEam4Sxdt1ZV2KVA","xELHFjE3M6KwtD49g--JcA"

"Not visiting again! Ribs great but prices have gone up with lesser quantity.  Table of 4 & 3 of the orders were wrong with items missing & not ordered items added.  Missing side of slaw was dropped off in a container holding a forkful of slaw. Collard greens were extremely bland.  The only things that tasted great were the ribs & baked beans.  Plates were covered with fries (not ordered) to hide the smaller portions of ribs & BBQ.  They have lost a long time customer.","2016-11-27","0","6qDRqHWqf0EeHupSUEBfKg","L3Fskdgven4zThFNSqRDgw"

No response from web designers, massive spelling errors, out-dated website design and imagery, not following instructions (clear ones) about what I want. And on and on. And to boot, customer service was horrid. Problems weren't fixed even after being discussed. Multiple times.

"Love the bar, which is separate from the dinner area, and overlooking patio seating emerged with the cobblestone of Old Montreal. 

Although The Keg is located in the heart of the city's busiest  tourist stroll-about, the bar's pub-like character embodies a visitor to feel like a local.

"Clean, great ambiance, quiet if u sit away from the bar. Really good seafood.  Sourdough bread is great. Crab Louis salad was great, but next time I will ask for HALF the amount of dressing or have it put on the side. The mashed potatoes had a lot of butter in them -- I would ask for them to go easy.  Somebody there really likes to load on the cooking fats!  Husband said green beans tasted strange.  I would go again but ask for less butter & mayo\/dressing on things. Service a bit slow.","2015-10-01","0","P2GBKrx7dJg3xeGtuU2K-A","OYNXc-Dhnm2w6tbFrnIjtg"

"Visiting and had to try TPC on 2\/9\/14. We booked for 4 and were greeted by a guy who set us up with rental clubs. The course is beautiful and challenging. The blue tee was recommended by the starter, which we discovered was a bit much for us. The ranger (Bob) met us on the course, very friendly guy who gave us a better overview of the course. He recommended we try the blended tees, which we did. This was one of the better tips we received. We played in about 4 hrs, never rushed at a good pace.","2014-02-12","0","uou1yGwuLMNA39iHaAASbQ","8nr_kSnf9CKIcbIFaV0mfQ"

"I've been here three times so far. The first two times my burger was great. Tonight on the other hand... It was over cooked and semi-warm. It also seemed like the cooks had made the regular burger with American cheese and realized the order was for a different burger and just put a piece of cheddar on top (which was not very good along with the fact that neither slices were even melted). 
I had also requested a side of ranch with my fries and was given bleu cheese which I am not a fan of.","2014-08-03","0","H9a6IRS0edhW343Y2kXSSA","dccTtRHP_qpdL09etGnrrg"

Waiters and waitresses ignored us as they busily took other tables' orders or cleaned counters. Attempts to make eye contact didn't work. Friendly smiles and waves to wait staff didn't work. NO ONE wanted to take our order. Over 20 min waiting to place an order (on a not so busy morning) we paid for our cup of coffee and left.

The salesman that was ""up"" for us, decided that we weren't worth his time and went to help some other salesman unload water meant for ""customers"". We told management and we were told that that he couldn't see his people ignoring a family of four but he could see them ignoring a single woman. Our mouths dropped and we got out of there as fast as possible.","2014-03-08","0","ztCmuPxfKf3_L3QjUCYMHQ","ywbRCFjoBfRX_fUPvxFOSA"

"Margarita Olmedo Contreras is an super amazing saleswoman! She got me my 2ND car after the first one got totaled and she made the experience even faster and easier than before, and with nothing down!!! I love my new Ford Fusion and my advice to anyone looking for a vehicle- go to Maggie at Auto Nation Ford Scottsdale! She is vibrant, warm, efficient and consistent with getting everything taken care of!  Thank You Maggie!","2016-11-15","0","ztCmuPxfKf3_L3QjUCYMHQ","CKShR6NTrkfcZ91DwPdsgw"

"I wanted to give some positive feedback on my experience at AutoNation Toyota Tempe, AZ.

From the beginning on Monday March 17, my sales rep Greg Weiser gave me exceptional customer service and made my purchase smooth and hassle free

In addition, this week- while bringing in my vehicle for the scheduled sunroof installation- I received exceptional care and attention to detail by my service advisor Richard Kazanjian. 

I've had great customer service !","2014-04-02","0","d0z2wUeAuqB5eSpMQ4fC1w","-0kjabzuEu5BMFpDdTpQsQ"

"Ken Pahl & Elijah Schneller were awesome to deal w at AutoNation Tempe Toyota. Both he and Eli made the sale of my new RAV one of the smoothest car sales ever. They were more than fair and ""not high pressure"". Highly recommend this dealership for not only their fabulous selection, best prices ever, and knowledgeable and professional staff. Thanks Eli and Ken.

"Garlic knots,,, A+ ,,, soft fresh dough baked to an outside crisp. Wonderful seasoning and the sauce served with them is very fresh and complimenting (not overpowering). The Stromboli was the same. Fresh and full of Italian flavor!

"Terrible service. I have gone to this salon for two years and brought everyone I know here. Yesterday, I brought my fiancé, mother in law, sister in law and niece and we all got pedis. When they tried to upcharge my 12 year old niece, the staff was told not to perform this service on her. They rushed to finish up my niece and sister in law's pedis while the rest of us were still enjoying ours for another 15 minutes. The staff did not perform cuticle trim or anything except polish.","2013-07-07","0","7DVwavMeWzafxkqxAtAV4g","taXyhIeFfO4utv-J0q8Xig"
"When we brought it to the owners attention, she was unreasonable and would not fix the problem. She said her feet looked soft and ""no polish on skin"". It is absurd that anyone should leave with an unsatisfactory pedi. There was not a single other customer in the salon for 50 minutes, at 3pm on a Saturday. If you choose to visit this salon, expect to get ripped off and assume that you are wrong if you didn't like the service performed. Be warned.","2013-07-07","0","7DVwavMeWzafxkqxAtAV4g","taXyhIeFfO4utv-J0q8Xig"

We learned our lesson and won't be back. We're sticking to Buffalo Wild Wings. we came to get a drink, It tasted like juice and no alcohol at all.

"Horrible restaurant, do not come here unless you want dry bad food and items that don't match the Menue description, service is bad as well! Ordered a fried porkchop with salad and it came with plain melons. Asked the staff and was met with rudeness claiming it is a fruit salad, how is it a fruit salad when it's plain 1 type of fruit with no dressing?? Gesh, admit your mistake.  For such a common Menu item this is not acceptable, plus the porkchop was dry and the staff is very dismissive.","2014-03-08","0","i_t_UJTSScw4srpb8aHUiw","n9QO4ClYAS7h9fpQwa5bhA"

Your carefully selected staff are well adjusted to the mysteries left behind in your establishment.

Ali had the drive, motivation and courage to track me, the owner of Salinger literature and inform me of its whereabouts. For as my hat was tipped, I now say hats off to the clever Ali.

Came in to do pink and white which I called before I came to make sure they had time for me which he said he did but when I got there the woman said she was the only one who could do acrylics so I settled for gel nails. She put the baggies and lotion on my hands and in the heater. Then she left into another room and NEVER CAME BACK. Are you kidding me?!?! I just got up and told the woman I was leaving.","2014-03-10","0","wMaWLXh8xBgStWrAbGNIyg","ce3MbOxEdlig0veqy-KCWw"

Food is always great as well. But the thing that sets this place apart is the service. Everyone is so friendly and helpful! They are always right on top of things to make sure you have everything you need. Especially Hector. The nicest server assistant we have seen here. Thank you!

"Absolutely wonderful place to get your hair done! As students, we are monitored by our educators\/instructors and with each new guest, we grow more & more confident in our skills. 
I am not only a student here, but have also had my hair colored by Kelli. She's a few months ahead of my class and was absolutely amazing. She's a rock star with blonde-tones, balayage, ombres and more. Come in for our awesome specials and fabulous hairdressers-in-training! :)","2014-08-19","0","fpI774695zba93qNg0YgTQ","O1y7Ck5e3B6o-mlc38TzKA"

"We went in and asked for a cup of coffee. The guy said it was fresh. My dad took a sip of it and it was disgusting! Bitter and tasted like it was sitting there for hours. We got two donuts and kindly said we didn't want the coffee unless they'd make a fresh pot. Well the cashier was rude and  said no. So we only wanted to pay for the doughnuts. She still tried to charge us for the coffee. And as we were walking out, she poured that same cup of coffee my dad drank out of, back in the pot!

"Ew don't even bother with this so called ""Thai"" place. Came here cause we were on vacation here in Cleveland and it was down right the worst Thai food I've had in The server was sooo rude I couldn't even believe it she was mumbling under her breath because we had to send a couple of dishes back. The overall taste was fishy and nasty along with the same horrid service. Don't waste your time or money here.","2013-06-25","0","JHtxvPm0XFAeGJ1OdviCrA","wdp2HYx9cwZeeS3Q3NJTOA"

If you're hungry, order salads from the regular menu. U can always tweak it w\/the server. My server tonight was accommodating. I ordered the Cobb Salad n instead of just romaine she let me hv half o it n arugula. Then, instead of the bacon, I got to choose two different sides so I chose hearts o palm and cucumbers.

"I'll begin with the awesome part of my experience: CANDIS. Warm, welcoming, informative of specials and how their consignment program works. The manager on duty can learn a LOT from Candis. The items were nice enough and the store well arranged, but the manager was curt, almost as if she couldn't be bothered. I was new to the location but not the name. And while checking out, she yells out Candis's name to draw attention to some display stand. Maam, customers first! If not for Candis...tsk tsk","2016-09-12","0","svlXCnKihlQrgtczTk4SLQ","ZVwStQnNCPbhO_pU4sNqOA"

With the super long construction process to get this place ready , the anticipation for something unbelievable was expected. The result..... Fell far short. Absolutely don't see this place lasting.

"The worst place to get Craft Beer in Charlotte.  Both times I went here when it was right down from Elevation Church I waited 15 minutes before anyone came up to ask me if I wanted a beer.  Some fatass guy sat on the couch texting or playing on his phone while I sat at the bar waiting to get served.  Beer was above temp, service sucked, place was uninviting.  Would not go back if this was the last craft beer store in NC,  I Hope you fail in the new spot, and oh yea, learn about beer, Peace!!","2015-09-15","0","iDwv7sbU6roz0I3Q_GRzAQ","JU29lvPmdz7ZECKxK9IsqQ"

Ordered half off filet, truffle mac, and sharp cheddar broccoli (my fav). Amber ale is half price between 5-8pm as well. Great meal, great atmosphere.  Owner, Mr. Mendoza, even came out to greet us at our table. Don't be discouraged by the outside, inside is charming and comfortable.

"Suggestions?Taste everything but not the classic cause it's nothing special and it's the base dish 4all the other poutines. So take the one with other ingredients (likeMushrooms,Vegetables..). Wide choise of dishes. The place?much more a kind of fast food than a restaurant, but warm.  Potatoes? not so special cause they were flabby. Is that the original recipe? Maybe too much people to wait on. Cheese? Not melted down and tasty but gummy! Price good 4quantity.

Then because the flight crews use this shuttle they are a priority, even going to the hotel?? I was not allowed on to the 12 passenger limo and had to wait additional 30 min. After midnight by myself! While about 20 crew piled in the limo. The airport shuttles must have come by 20 times in that hour.","2015-08-22","0","JtrOIfm4pIBEZgRIlwI_Jw","aWN3UyirY-gNtSRuy7LOGA"

There was no enthusiasm from the girl that did my sons cut.  Zero customer service.  She looked like she hated her job.  Also was dressed quite inappropriately for a children's salon.  Cleavage is not necessary for that kind of environment.   It was no different from any other dry salon like a best cuts.","2014-04-16","0","lKC4TcCzszmd-2Ak2GCH5A","rJTEz1zrXdUAQI7CjOpzKA"

"I really enjoyed this place when it first opened.  Over the years, the cleanliness has become a huge issue.  The girl who answers the phone is always miserable.

I just can't go back.","2015-11-05","0","aAiDjaeWjiD8XxRBGMLKyw","_L2E-h-ja-nqh0D3D91TEQ"

"One of our favorites for BBQ.  I like both the pulled pork and the beef brisket.  There is eight sauces ranging from mild to very spicy.  Their beans are good but a little to spicy for me. Most of the dinners come with two sides and corn muffin, which really good only wish they would serve the muffin warm or fresh from the oven, also wouldn't mind seeing that you can order more muffins it always seems to be the first thing to go.","2014-03-24","0","8dK-8e006F_it5bNxTVlaQ","9WPbBpZRntfkh0OagG0C2A"

"If you are considering doing the Rock N Roll Half Marathon Vegas, you will have a blast. Stick with  the half marathon, since the full marathon takes you to ugly parts of Vegas. I did the inaugural  and the 2016 race. Run the strip at night and see all the great attractions up close. Every mile has entertainment.  This is one of the best Rock N Roll Marathons that I have ran. FYI: if you don't like to wait in stalls, this run isn't for you.

"The food is good and the happy hour prices are great but the service is the worst. 7 out of 8 of our party had arrived and they still wouldn't seat us. We were told that if we took a seat for 7 and our last showed up that she would not be able to sit with us regardless if there was room or not. I could understand if it was 1 of 8 but come on!","2013-07-16","0","16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg","UVLd4ii9V4OoVS00KvH4mQ"

"The place has a rustic feel similar to the remote run-down Mexican Taco place.  The atmosphere resembles more of mixed variety of various cultures close to a melting pot of Korean, American, Mexican, and Italian cuisines. The background wood and distracting interior was atrocious to the point that I lost my appetite especially with bamboo in the back of the restaurant. It is distasteful and I do not plan on coming back to this establishment ever. The service is mediocre with their rudeness.","2014-06-01","0","MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw","NLi-FolKoFVonkbdWgI4iw"

"Has good food!!! Personally think the menu is too big for one short ordered cook to handle. Something is always late or wrong. Everytime that I go there is always only one waitress on. Not enough for the amount of business that goes in. For ex. There are 31 guests in the diner right now for one girl & one cook. Good food is you like to wait & have to hope it will be right. It's too bad there isn't another place to go in the area.","2013-05-10","0","dDLRhywKVjnSIFe4H5tu_w","73mPy0pv3grD5uq_6oRGzQ"

"Found out from a mutual friend that this establishment had changed ownership since the last time we were here (see my previous review). 

The ownership may have changed and the interior does look much nicer with updates and an added bar area but nothing else has improved. 

Barbie still makes the tiny toast, the so called ""home fries"" are Ore Ida frozen potato cubes ( we call them bag & spoon fries) and the overall portion sizes and quality is not good at all.

"I've used Ed on several occasions over the past 18 years. He saved me from buying two disasters that looked great, felt good and were priced right. Some dealers don't love him, but I understand why.

I had heard about this place through a few friends and decided to try it out today. It was absolutely the most wonderfully authentic Mexican food i have had in nearly 10 years.  The meat was seasoned perfectly, the toppings bar was great, and the little street corner atmosphere was fun.

The pork belly - kopitas were okay. They had a sourness to them that I attributed to the apple. The duck quesadillas were a huge disappointment. The duck was way overcooked and the naan bread was almost burnt. Overall we gave it a 6 out of 10, and probably won't go back.","2013-09-13","0","MTCyh5VqkKp1LIvfeI-TTg","RXcSx-Ve4D9viVyXfPM0iw"

"Been here for 1 hour & 20 minutes and everyone is upset. We were the first ones here and now this line. This night shift is a joke. They don't give a shit about anybody's time.

"This school is terrible! At first they come off as very nice. They'll promise you anything to trap you into enrolling there! Once you're hooked, you're pretty much on your own. If you have any issues, their Student Services Advisers are extremely rude and unhelpful. You're treated almost as if you're another figure on a spreadsheet. I've been treated with more respect at other learning institutions. I would recommend that you do not waste your time here.","2015-07-07","0","Z7YXJnQ5ZWIrSmqyrFqhBg","UyMHMTwQoUk9bGkXXyfqog"

"Tacos were ok. Chicken was too sweet and mushy for me. Short rib tacos had good composition and flavor. I am a bit disappointed in the tortillas though. They could have at least grilled then for 5 seconds. Seemed store bought, doughy, and bland. Not my place but not horrible. Maybe I should try their burgers though.","2013-05-22","0","Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA","9WLY2ephMkaLBGgxg92-QA"

"Well I actually liked this restaurant until they charged as much for hot water as they do for the beverage.

"I've been coming to Jerk King consistently since its inception for its friendly service and its hearty and well-priced food. I have to declare that the fried chicken here is hands-down one of the best in the city. For just $4, you get the heavenly experience of biting into two crispy, juicy, well-seasoned, tender pieces of chicken. You also get to watch as people after you start ordering the chicken too based on your expression alone!","2013-08-16","0","YLPNiyf3rVKINhT1CvTeZw","ttIye9qeDzYZZVMyjqq-RQ"

"My favourite of the ""Jerk King"" locations, and not just because its down my street, they just do something special here. Its tiny, so there isn't much seating. If you're alone, or with a friend, and just plan on eating quickly, its okay for that, otherwise I recommend to go. The price is right for the amount of food you're getting, and the food is always delicious.

"Ridiculously fantastic burgers. I'm speachless. Burger cooked to temp, seasoned beautifully. Simply dressed. I'm IMPRESSED. Service fenominal. Chris Hodges, the manager, was hospitable and went the extra mile to suggest the ""Fido Burgers"" that are unseasoned burgers for our four legged kiddos. No picture but this because honestly I couldn't wait to get it in my mouth. The rosemary, olive oil, and sea salt shoestring fries were out of this world. I can't wait to come back.

"Rudy, the owner of SunsationLV, and his business are amazing!! He arrived at our home with all the necessary equipment to get a spray tan and he was so professional. I wanted no tan lines so there I stood naked and very embarrassed, but he helped to make me feel so comfortable as he walked me through the steps to get tanned...all in the privacy of my own home. For a very affordable price you can have an instant tan in minutes without laying in the hot sun for 
hours. Thanks so much!!!

"For serious motorcyclists who love their bikes I highly reccomend Go AZ motorcycles. You will not find a better group of people anywhere. The level of service you recieve will make you feel like a Rockstar. I've been doing business with them for four years now... And my experience gets better and better.Mark Ledesma is the best technician I've ever seen anywhere. You will not find this level of professional service anywhere... They are truly fantastic.They are worth it. They're great!!

You used to have to wait to get in. I see now why it's slow. We asked for a booth and they got upset even tho booths were available. We never got bread we had to ask for it.

Charges for cleaning vehicles that are returned in such poor condition that the vehicle must be sent out for detailing, will be charged in proportion to the level of cleaning that is needed.

"To clarify about my review on Dr. Mohammed Akl, it's more the staff. I called 5 times, left messages (M-F) and my husband called once. When I finally called back again, I pressed the number to get to the front desk. I told them I had been calling all week and she put me through to a nurse. It took 6 calls and I didn't find out that they called me in something for menopause for 1\/1\/2 weeks later. I'm sure the doctor knows nothing about this but someone could have called back to apologize.","2016-07-26","0","G6vkzaoXXPxETLC62GQ1Fg","nYCGV9kideUd-MiidI7eZw"

"There is a legal maximum charge that you can be charged for a non police ordered tow that is set in your city ordinance. In Phoenix,  for example, it is $105 and a $12 a day storage fee.  They CAN NOT charge you more than that.  I live in Laveen, AZ, which is a village in Phoenix,  and they tried to charge me $200 for the tow and $15 storage. I am a cop in Phoenix and had to call in other Officers who were on duty to have them comply with the law.  Do your homework,  they are bottom feeders.","2015-12-25","0","YakO7e9dxaYk5WrkNyRVFQ","pWjBiv1UPLXPAtPUuf8IRw"

                         Recently I decided to have 15 dresses   fitted after losing a considerable amount of weight.
 I noticed an ad in a magazine and checked it out.
Ester Tailoring is located in the shopping plaza on the s\/w corner of 99th Ave and Bell Road in Sun City.
 I found Esther to be very professional,  pricing is quite reasonable, and most importantly her work is exceptional.

I  contacted Vlad on Saturday when my front load washer stopped working in the middle of the cycle.
Vlad showed up during the time frame he said he would. I found Vlad to be very professional.  He is  very honest  and helpful  is not one to make repairs for personal gain.
Vlad made a minor repair and only charged me for a service call. I would highly recommend him to anyone. Refreshing to find a appliance repair man who is honest","2013-11-18","0","wQWhzyZNzFQKAOiSVEXCwA","Ge23ey1uUD2Wb97oFwatuA"
"Elite TKD Gilbert, AZ. Good instruction but terrible accommodations for a parent to watch. Classes are overcrowded for the facilities.  Master Kim seriously needs to consider expanding or finding a larger facility. For the money we pay we should be able to have somewhere to sit other then the floor.

"The series is wonderful!  The music sucks.  If you love vacuous pop music, you'll really dig the addition of music to a 'meditative' practice.  For me...it was a total distraction to be subject to the tastes of pop music of the instructor.  Further, they've got music with lyrics playing while there is instruction.   Could you learn from a teacher while someone else was talking at the same time?","2016-04-09","0","mvOSTtXnJd80ZU-o6xm1rw","fzWFNA-eIbJQyIF9aIA0AA"

When asked if some boots that were out of stock could be shipped to the store since they were out, the girl said she didn't know if they get shippments and left it at that.

"My boyfriend and I are that annoying couple that overtones and asks a lot of questions!After receiving wonderful tips and quality service from Jennifer we looked at another Mattress Frim location and received similar amazing care! The consistent quality from store to store really says something about this company! I am happy to say we ended with Jennifer though! She got us a great deal on our mattress set and made sure we were always taken care of! We would recommend them to anyone!!","2016-01-25","0","va83uf-TvQyr9pLJwTflbw","BB8JZfD6DSK4wMQv0bGS3A"

"Nice club but I travel Internationally a lot. I liked the idea of putting my membership on hold for $10 a month.  But then they charge another $10 for a processing fee.  Then the processing few went to $25 for a $10 charge.   The last time, the processing fee was $45.00 for a $10 charge. That's 3 processing fee increases in less than 12 months.  That's crazy and unethical.  So that's when I quit the club.

"Hello,

We came in on Friday night at 6:30pm and wanted to sit at the bar area and asked if they could clean off one of the many dirty tables since he just cleaned off one if the tables for someone else. The host said he was told don't clean off the tables because they were too busy in the bar to take any more guests. So we were instructed to wait for a seat in the main dining area. I couldn't believe what i was told. So five tables sat dirty on a Friday night.

"Everything is extra.  If u r alone charge flat rate same small psnl size as xx large size..... that means is $9 for the base sml pizza...plus $3 each topping.  So you are alone or the only one that wants pizza you have to pay $3  per topping,  same rate as huge pizza.  extra sauce is ""topping"".","2013-07-27","0","RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw","RM7cn9CgINUnZScxhfTl7Q"

I don't remember quite right, but I do remember it was a lot.  Sad.  It's bad enough those animals have to spend their lives caged up like prisoners.

"Jenny was amazing. But DON'T get your nails done by the guy. You will waste a lot of money!!! Less than a week later every nail was badly lifting. The primer he used was crap. Not only that but a crack he fixed by just placing acrylic over snapped the nail three days later tearing my real nail. It bled pretty bad and hurt for days. The acrylic area by my cuticles was really rough too. Like it wasn't worth him filing it down. My nails looked like garbage a week later.","2013-09-15","0","oM6TsEcgj4i9McivZnu5EA","sV2byruBDj6IXSyLI38yRA"

"My extended warranty just ran out and I have only been to the dealership for maintenance and repairs. Meineke was super fast and affordable. Troy hooked me up.

I take it all back! They put the wrong size brakes on and they started squealing. They tried to blame it on my driving but replaced them after much back and forth. The second set was just as crappy as the first. They weren't much cheaper than the dealership. I will NEVER go back!","2012-11-14","0","5tn1rq69i7XJOONablNrAw","whWZZaV_qtae0g62BDV4sg"

He, of course tried to get me to choose the Synthetic oil at 79.95 (69.95 was displayed). He said he knock $10 off. Hmm!!! I told him I wanted regular oil at $39.95. About 20mintues had passed when he informed me that my car requires 0w 20 and it only came in..........you guessed it, synthetic.

"So far not so good.  The appointment was at 4.:00 PM and we were 15 minutes early.  Did the questionnaire and had the blood pressure done about 20 minutes after we got here. It has now been an 1 hour and 35 minutes and still no doctor. The staff is nice but that only goes so far.  If you can't see your patients in a timely manner you should do one of two things,  a: hire more staff or b: make less appointments.  Finally see the doctor and he's rude. I'd suggest going somewhere else.","2016-03-22","0","Kg3BfZdGuMkM1LBgi1e79g","I66RdvP7MUxfWyJScTfIqA"

"Only get a unit that has plenty of parking at night as parking abuse here is an annoying problem that management doesn't care about.  

Get a garage so there's less of a chance that your car will get broken into.

Have a reputable locksmith reinforce your door locks (or hell - install a new, higher-quality one) so you don't get your door kicked down by burglars.

The house dressing has a nice hint of garlic, and they provide a healthy amount of feta cheese. I also love their sliced lamb so flavorful I don't think ill ever get any other meat on my Gyros. The photo is a pic of their Greek salad to go.","2013-09-15","0","5VeKrLlQdJjMmKGwBBvMmw","3N9-Kk7kcyhLvBseaKPUeQ"

"I can not say enough good things about Yanni's. We usually come several times a week and each time is better than the last! 

The shawarma pita and feta fries could win international awards. I've eaten this type of food across the country and in Europe and Yanni's is by far the best I've ever had. 

The restaurant is always clean. The staff is friendly and the owner, Assad, treats his customers like family.

"I simply can't believe how amazing Gerna w\/ A Saavy Skin Care is!  Over the past 5 years I've known I needed help with my skin care, but was overwhelmed by the MILLION facial-types out there.  When I found Gerna, I knew within minutes, I was where I needed to be!  Not only does she KNOW what she's doing,  she educates you, supports you, and is very honest.  I have never been given information that has been wrong, as she always sends me home with ""what to expect"".   Thanks!!!!","2013-05-22","0","EnJji0DEG1VupmZbj9bicQ","kZt7fFkN-6VKG3XOVVWW6Q"

I traded in the car 6 months later and now they refuse to give me a refund for the difference which of course was never explained to me by the Suburu dealer who sold me such a terrible warranty on an Audi A4 !","2016-06-29","0","mmMihsgFSb_7fp5rAXiW_A","z5NukRFi9RF7GBEpiytEyg"

One day she went to get her hair done an hour before the last wash & Andi would not take her. To make matters worse she didn't even have any customers. My experience with Andi was she kept charging me different price for the same hairstyle, and it was always more not less.

This brace too hard to walk or do anything so I never able to use anyway.
Maybe I wouldn't mind to pay if this brace helps a lot but I can't even use!!
I called them so many times but Dr said NO to return.
If he says so,I have to do whatever he says ?

"For those reading tips on our business, we have a buzzer system in place. If our employees have to use the restroom for example we have them turn on the lock. I know for a fact our salon was open Nov 23rd at 2pm. We get people that come around soliciting so the employees sometimes turn the lock on to avoid dealing with them. Also at dark, we always use the buzzer system. We close early a few times a year on Holidays and that's it and we give our clients 2-3 weeks advance notice. Thank you!","2014-12-22","0","ZKOMfMAiCY_H0isiQQXYOg","YNO3X6v7tfAsK2-Ah7uVeg"

Got a free banana pudding for dessert and that was delicious too.

It is something my husband wears every day, so we realized it immediately the day following our cleaning. 
It's strange to say that we misplaced 3 things, so theft is our first reaction.
We are cancelling our services until they show up and investigate the situation... Hide your valuables.","2015-11-10","0","_tdW1CRiHJKJf-nWn7j0eA","wEBpdvOUAAntQ9_g0pgXYQ"

"Try not to make your customers feel like criminals. Went in to try Impact Kitchen for the first time today at 10 Am. I had the lady at the front watching me like a hawk from the moment I went in. I paid in advance and when I got my order she asks ""have you paid for this?""

Why ask that? Because I'm running a chia scam where I walk out without paying?

I'll never be back.","2015-10-30","0","u6ylhDrUV1v6g5Aex8rebw","Z4GRk8QgoT48qTMZDzAaWw"

Please fix the sandwich! It has potential but the bread just needs to be heated and fresher. Will try again in a few weeks to see if there's any improvement.","2017-05-31","0","ZtO4zPjnk_U9ieFbVcjvJw","3hU-Wa_TXiVW66Vf020uPg"

"First time I went to the Pita Shack was last summer and they didn't have the air-conditioning on, very uncomfortable.

Last week I gave it another shot, figured it was cool enough outside to be safe. Good thing, because no AC again. I got half way through my gyro and bit down on a small bone, cartilage, or something else. It freekin hurt my tooth. I didn't complain or anything, I just won't be going back.

This is hands down the BEST place in the city for middle eastern food! Their customer service is outstanding and welcoming. I enjoy the peaceful, friendly atmosphere with its casual vibe. If you're in the mood for tasty, food and a plethora of options this is the place for you.

Once in, its nice with a feel of old traditional study room: wooden floor, walls. The cafe is just a counter in a corner. I only had a chicken wrap with orange juice and those cost me $6.75... wouldnt say its cheap. Probably good for tea\/coffee n cookies... anyway, i ll go there again just for being so close to kings college circle.","2014-02-25","0","ZZXLiDkBUdrasopHpLQxiQ","Jl2spJbqqF1a27MhviAbvQ"

"Came here for the famous pancakes and shrimp cocktail. The pancakes definitely lived up to the hype!! They were slightly crispy, flavorful, and fluffy at the same time!! I've never had pancakes like these in my life! 

Shrimp cocktail was also yummy. My only was was that the shrimps were a bit bigger. They were the kind of small shrimps you find in fried rice. Maybe a tiny bit larger.","2015-11-26","0","Qihead6oTtWCwde3TBqlGg","jwFmZvSjgnQcIHE-_GPSvQ"

"Completely understaffed and overwhelmed with a full restaurant.

"BEWARE! If using a Groupon or Living Social voucher, I just figured out what they do with the bill, they auto add a 20% tip off the total amount into the check and THEN deduct the Living Social voucher ($30), then you tip another 15-20%!! So wait staff ends up with a 40% tip!?! Obviously because people were only tipping off of the reduced amount so they said we will fix that, and now I remember reading the sign that said they're going to add a surcharge... beware!","2016-02-15","0","q5I1eO_K6AHC-3B8DB9Caw","H0i9DqQ58jPn-esqARcDlg"

"El Segundo, worth going to on  strip for 1) from scratch, table-side Guacamole and 2) Organic chicken fajitas. Otherwise, just your average indoor\/outdoor Tex Mex spot - but with a cool little outdoor bar with frozen drinks in machines (not my thing) and cold beers, mist machine keeps you cool.","2013-07-03","0","Rj-7ymdw8aNZBRqGRAjR3Q","3kCRM9mULm2wJ45yVFVqNQ"
