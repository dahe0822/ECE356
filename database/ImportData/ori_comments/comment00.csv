Not to mention China lobsters servers are some of the friendliest around,  they're always smiling, happy and make you feel very welcomed.  Also they're buffet is 13.50 but offers about 5 to 6 huge shrimp selections which are incredible.  I don't know where anyone else is getting unlimited shrimp but I guarantee you aren't getting that here are top China.","2016-05-25","0","ZU6pUJNBGXQZrWD9zEHtuQ","bhHDgSlm4npCdgxYqYHcVw"

"Quality over quantity.  Anyone whining about quantity needs to go to fortune star where you'll find a ton of selections but get mediocre food.  They now have chili shrimp,  fantail fried shrimp,  salt and pepper shrimp,  and a new house shrimp that is similar to general tsos.  There is no Chinese buffet offering that amount of shrimp for dinner, and huge shrimp to boot,  for that price.  It's all you can eat shrimp for under 14 bucks.  I'd pay 20 for this buffet.","2016-06-16","0","AB6xAAxRRVS8tJgbW1aphw","bhHDgSlm4npCdgxYqYHcVw"

"Service was NOT up to par. I ordered food to go and i came to the counter to pick it up,  the girl asked if i was there for the take out, said yes,  she went back got it and gave me total.  I asked her if they had to-go drinks and she said NO? I left and went to gas station to get a drink.  No big deal,  but i called back and started a ""fake"" order and asked the woman on the phone if they had to-go drinks and she said YES?! I was very confused on why the first girl didn't just get me a drink.","2016-06-25","0","6wE8dDtLMrtEa3Pz7MWQMw","yUmEBt_NayUxGhKBnH094Q"

"Why Ship Your Car When You Can Drive?

I am so glad you asked. When you drive your car long distances you are doing more than filling your gas tank. You are increasing your mileage and decreasing the value of your car, decreasing the life of your engine, tires and other critical parts, increasing the chances of an accident significantly. It may even seem cheaper on the surface to fill up your tank and go, but as you can see, we are the affordable alternative to costly wear and tear on your car.","2016-01-24","0","D71xljonXjT6KHU_NhgyRA","ZomdepTKLXKITg_8GpNCug"

"No doubt Kennywood as a whole is a dream for Pittsburghers. The only complaint is the garbage food choices and the excessive pricing for the low quality. One change during 2013 was the chicken strips sold at Small Fry. Until this year they were natural strips of chicken breast meat. Now, they switched to processed, preforrmed nuggets. Thanks!  And thanks from the kids who get to enjoy scrap food.  Raise the standards, not just profits.","2013-08-16","0","28exW1xiocTHiJIkVY2A9g","FjSDhPEmyjFqj9-BBZ9x-g"

"Avoid the shopping center on Steeler Sundays, holidays, and the 4th of July. It is a legit madhouse. People are cutthroat crazy around these times in an already tight parking lot! The 4th of July is an interesting time for this area. They have a parade and if you drive down Brownsville road a few days prior to the 4th , you can see all the chairs people set out to reserve their spot for the parade. I would definitely steer clear of this shopping center a few days before and the day of the 4th.","2014-09-20","0","qC7ATMm1D0Y0-G2dxwMYmw","l3ryB3Q6WZ3uHDHVe2HgoA"

My current dentist is not even sure they did a bone graft as I have pretty much no bone where the tooth was extracted.  I will get a refund!!!

"I was also instructed that I needed to have a ton of root canals done and then crowns would need to be completed.  They also wanted me to return in one week after the extraction to start a bridge for the extracted tooth.  The area needs 6 - 8 weeks to heal before a bridge can be completed.  I went to my new\/old dentist today who told me that I do not need all those root canals!!!  Now I have to see an oral surgeon to see if he can even repair the damage done so I can get a bridge!!!","2014-05-08","0","7l_ZuvbtQE9AW8dx5NUi0Q","ZkfP2Ps6dXUT-qpOFFNxkQ"

"Female doctor said she could pull them. Managed to break 2 of the 3 teeth before she stopped. Then they attempted to push us out the door like it's my problem...find your own surgeon!  I had to wait a week..in pain..to see their surgeon and be sedated to remove the 2 broken teeth. I've been to many dentist offices and they said Aspen Dental should have stepped up and got the surgeon into the Waterfront office ASAP! EMERGENCY SURGERY!

"In my 17 years of legally drinking I just came across the worst bartender I have ever seen. With a bar of maybe 20 people she could not ask me if I needed another beer, an off the clock employee got me my first 1 because I waited so long when I sat down. An hour went bye, watched her cash out a bunch of people, saw her look at my empty glass twice, look at the floor and turn around and walk away. Go somewhere else if you came out to drink if Dionna is working.","2013-05-19","1","PME-GPdNrrTUJ2uSY16rpg","LVChK4kvG_mdRdEsk34PkA"

"The pizza here is horrible.  The service is very good though.  The employees are very nice. But please put some money into your ingredients.  This isn't even made with real cheese.  Come on!!! I spent $20 getting a large pizza delivered and it wasn't even fully cooked and the cheese and crust tasted synthetic.  It was like eating elementary school cafeteria pizza.  Wait.  That was better tasting.  Save yourself the drama , just order from mama lenas down the street , they taste good.","2016-09-02","0","_XAoV-292ygR5Wb4qssyDQ","uRrk4iuVNt5sqj2B1E2tFA"

I picked it up today only to find holes through it. It looks like they sewed it and then realized they messed it up and removed the stitches leaving needle holes the entire way around the satin dress.  It looks terrible. And it is crooked to boot.

"Whatever you do do not go here. This place is shit and you will get cold food and horrible service. Honestly the manager told me to stop talking at one point when I called him over so that tells you all you need to know. This place will treat you like shit and when you complain charge you for beers you didn't order. The manager Rick also tired to tell my dad that he ""saw him a in here before a lot"" when my dad doesn't live in town.

"This place is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. We were in Pittsburgh for the weekend and we went twice in 2 days for breakfast. The staff are extremely nice and welcoming, and they were helpful with choosing what to get. The pumpkin pancakes are the best I've had in my life, no joke. They're an absolute MUST. The banana chocolate chip pancakes were amazing. The jumbot is awesome. And their coffee is great. What more could you want in a breakfast place? Will definitely come back again if I'm in Pittsburgh.","2015-06-08","0","nlVjdQq9FzdQ3bfy-8y80g","uv96zIITIejGPu8R2RIb-w"

If this is a burger joint they should not reheat burgers as you lose the juices. Very disappointing.","2012-11-14","0","iRhB506lbc0kU5289zyHzg","A69QAmKSdW45kUIqd4FESg"

They take any credit card... As long as its the Costco AMEX.","2014-04-28","0","qpmd3uD2ffE29J6wK-RkrQ","0buwrNb-4PIfcsa5XOXOEg"

"I like the feel of this place. Not huge but definitely sizable and has all the right stuff. Currently going to Many More off the strip as it's lots closer, this is a destination when going to McKnight.

My current passion is Viet and Thai and altho this place is run by Chinese, it serves these and other regional cuisines. Goodly choice of fish sauces, sriachas, chili sauce, noodle and all the other fixings you enjoy from any competent Asian market.

"Agree that the fusion concept is intriguing. Started with the mussel 3 ways, the uni tomato cream linguini and the spaghetti squid ink for the 2 of us. The entree portions were not large; they were just right. The flavors were good, but not exceptional. Had to order Kobe beef carpaccio because I was still hungry. The green tea panna cotta was very good. Cost is definitely a concern","2014-02-06","0","6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA","IWFWaJZC8tBPMVPcoPNSdA"

"Th main floor in the dining room is so filthy with dust iits  disgustingly filthy. I had NO idea the ladies room was closed until I went downstairs. The server directed me to the temporary bath room which was lit by one small light, couldn't see myself in the mirror and the dust was 1\/2 "" thick on the counter and shelf. The water in the troth from the wall, had a thick film over it that was stagnate.

"This is the most disgusting un flavorful Chinese food I ever had. After seeing reviews and people said it was the best haha I have to believe all of you have no taste buds. I ordered the general Tsos the chicken was mushy and tasted more like sweet and sour chicken. I also ordered the crab Rangoon more like fried greasy dough. Awful and don't get me started on the veggie lo mein ewww not even 4 packets of soy sauce could help the nasty taste.

"Best waffles I've ever eaten. Ok, may be pushing that but hands down a good hearty yummy place to enjoy breakfast, brunch & lunch! It gets busy certain times of day so be willing to wait...worth the wait. Good food! Plenty of food. Good prices! Enjoy!!","2014-03-08","0","OQvChaBImI8X5B3aai8btg","-f1xPBcJq-zy9nSadIpsxQ"

"I went there for brunch this weekend. The menu itself consisted of unnecessary complicated twists on traditional brunch items, I'm assuming to appeal to more hipster crowds (i.e. see hipster Benedict on the menu). The menu just makes you ask yourself instead, ""which food will I probably hate the least"". I got French toast and a couple of them weren't even cooked the whole way. It was mush on the inside, very unsafe since it was uncooked egg. I can confidently say I will not be going there again.","2017-07-09","0","qNSZpcyoF7OM6g49sAFUcQ","w0utfon2BcRsKdwp3Bty3Q"
