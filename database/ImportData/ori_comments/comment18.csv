"The best all you can eat shabu. The tapas used to be included now they are appetizers and cost extra but all the appetizers are $3 and under. We ate here on a Friday and they had scallops on the shell as a special included in the all you can eat. The vegetables, chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, fish, , won ton, and sizzling beef is good. Eat the sizzling beef while it's hot or it over cooks.","2014-06-21","0","PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ","0b-U2SXUEtgS49uxGot5ww"

"New ride is open. A lot of picnic tables and tented areas for shade. Not too crowded and the lines seem reasonable. The kids area is heated so the water is good. More tubes available in the lazy river. No outside food allowed except bottles of water. Parking isn't too bad but we like to park in the back parking lot.

"Today was the very firt time I've been to this salon. My friend recomended me this hair stylist. Her name is LENY. At first I was hesitant to go cuz I was told that my hair was soooo damaged and can't get my regulars blonde highlights I normally have. I had it done at another salon and turned out pretty bad. Soo brassy and orange looking. LENY did an amazingggg job one hair. Got the beautiful blonde highlights I wanted and she was so sweet!!!

Bread pudding needs some creme anglais to make it a swooning dessert. I wish these two could've been served warm though. It is chilly with robust AC, so you may want to bring a sweater.

"The directions to here will leave you at Albertsons shopping center to your right, but just keep going straight along Charleston toward those red rock mountains, it looks like a road going nowhere , but then you'll hit the visitor center.

"Make sure you have time to waste before going here. Came by at 1145 on a Saturday. Unfortunately walked up to a locked door. The sign said 11:00 & the yelp info stated 11:00. Waited for a good 10 minutes, still no show! Another group of 3 people came up hoping to check out the place and possibly purchase some goods.

Here's one for BJ's: If you love cheese, give the new creamy couscous mac & cheese a try. $4.95\/ less than a beer  at a nightclub on the strip...gets you a lot of cheesey fun..like me! =) Enjoy..","2017-05-13","1","uI-dbKk_9cUen7pi3-16Sg","AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ"

"Not a place for young adults. More like moms, titas, titos, and dads.
Drinks and food menu are cheap enough. On quality, the food: 
- the sisig fries took over 30 mins to get to the table - lukewarm and the shoestring fries were cold, no crunch to it.
- the chicken wings: crunchy outside, hard & dry inside, flavorless. Tasted like frozen chicken wings.

"Wow..a unique concept for dining in Las Vegas that isn't on the Strip! Everything about this place appealed to me. The graciousness and hospitality,  the customer service and the dessert. This is not your typical dessert place so don't think you're coming in here and spending a few bucks for a donut! No way baby, treat yourself on this one. It is a prix fixed menu but you choose the msin course. Great concept on the menu and bathroom.  Go see what I mean...","2013-08-10","1","umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ","Dff_MlN-_VZjm-AP_oFWhQ"

When I explained what I ordered she made a comment about the fact that we already ate part of the spring rolls.

Not many managers do that and I think that other managers need to take notes from Alam and chat up the customers more often, get to know the people who patronize your business.

I had the Eggs  Benedict,  it was ok, my hubby had the Pacers Hash which was 80%  potatoes, the pork was tough and he kept seasoning it with salt coz it had no taste, my daughter had the #5 burger and all she said was she was not happy with her burger either. We   must have gone on an off night, would like to give ti another try, but with their prices, we won't be going back.

"This place is absolutely horrible. The service is terrible; they treat you as though you are inconveniencing them. No one abides by the specials they promote, probably because half of the staff aren't aware of the specials to begin with. The food? Disgusting.

"Food wise, this was the best place so far, among all the restaurants we've been in Las Vegas. Customer service wise, waiters need to work on being proactive in identifying and\/or attending to what their customers may need to make their dining experience fabulous. They need training on properly approaching customers. Effective communication is a big thing. Overall, the place is worth going back to in our next vegas visit.","2014-08-25","0","jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg","qZLh5WJMk0Z2YkQXazhpxw"

"I have shopped here for years. Today I felt like I was being stalked by some stiff black security guard. He walked up on me four times, & every time he was dogging me. I felt like he was trying to provoke me. I just kept minding my business because I did not want any sort of verbal\/physical confrontations. At the check out he walked up to talk to the cashier as if I was a bad guy & he also stared me down again. Security for anything has never made me feel so unsafe & weird until today.","2015-10-11","0","zlcFSXKg96wKI-piiHc2BQ","mc1as4HSFGMxs_ki2J1sWw"

"STAY AWAY
from sprint, do not sign no contract 
nor buy a phone which works only on they network, they are all locked. they have no re-sale value. and the sprint service really sucks. no LTE, bad data, bad customer service, that's why so manny people are either paying the ETF's walking away or not doing business with sprint, I paid 120 dlls for early termination fee for 4 months left on my contract, and I was happy to pay & walk away & start with a new co. w\/ no contract no catches & no B.S.","2015-07-15","0","pjtgs1W1m8aWe31fvad2ww","OPMLrQ5An20MclW5YsLdvA"

This place is not child friendly at all, either.

1. Kirin ichiban sake bomber ($5). - 4*

2. Steamed Shrimp Bun ($3). - 5*
- Shrimps fresh and crunchy, flavorful

3. Steamed Pork Bun ($3). - 3.*
- Too Fatty, lacked char sui flavor

4. House Specialty Ramen with egg (off the Dinner Menu, $14.50). - 4.5*
- Tasty, piping hot shoyul broth with char Siu pork, shishito peppers, etc; Ramen had the right chew.
- Char Siu too fatty

"DECOR, 4*
- Pleasant, comfy. Fun to sit @ the counter to watch chefs work!

LUNCH 
1. Ebi tan udon ($11.95), 4*
- The broth could be better

2.Miso carbonara udon ($12.25), 3*
- Almost like Macaroni & Cheese with bacon.

3. Tempura shrimps ($2.25ea), 4*

4. Tempura soft eggs ($1.75ea), 5*

5. Octopus balls, ($7.75), 5*

SERVICE, 4*
- Friendly

RESTROOM, 4*
- Comfy, well maintained.

Muragame is larger & has better decor than Monta Ramen, BUT we like Monta Ramen's BROTH much better.

"First time at this place and I'm pleasantly delighted with the service. The food has a home cooked taste to it just like Mom makes (si soy Mexicano, yes I'm Mexican). Chips and salsa are excellent.   I had the carne asada plate with a green sauce chicken enchilada it came with rice and beans. The green sauce was a bit salty, but besides that I can't complain! I will definitely be back especially because if you have ten meals the 11th one is FREE!","2013-07-15","0","4NxIM5xpIEem1IkEkz2I7Q","YQGNjAe_6bsBkgfORBet-w"

"I hate the fact that the garden is on Main St so it is really noisy and you are just staring at traffic, but I guess it would be a great place to people watch especially downtown where there are sobe characters! The place is cooly decorated. The great thing about the bar is that it is smoke free, but I don't think the outside is (that sucks). They officially open in the beginning of March, so menu options are currently limited. Another great addition to downtown LV!","2014-02-14","0","3QzPhQ3ltbon0-1gC7Q18Q","YQGNjAe_6bsBkgfORBet-w"

"Tradewind represents the owners and does not care about the tenants. Example. The owner of my home let my sink stay broke for over a week. It leaked all over the place and everything in the house is about to break. They said they never got any of my three messages for maintenance. Then my wife went into tradewind and filled out a work order and then they claimed they lost it. Then they couldn't reach the owner. In the meanwhile I had no sink. Against hud regulations.

"My son had never been to daycare until he turned 4 years old. It was very intimidating to leave my child with just anyone. I looked at places that are corporate and felt that maybe my child wouldn't get the attention I felt like he needed being that this would be his first time in daycare. Nae Nae's has been wonderful. Lots of attention and a very positive feeling when you leave knowing your child is in good hands. My son loves it! I highly recommend Nae Naes to any parent who needs great care.","2014-04-04","0","mCQNt7t8akLpS0XuFBbQyA","YQJC4iLAreFeni6oqaLuHA"

Waitress sat down at our table. We asked a simple question and she just shrug her shoulders and said ""beats me, but you'll only be here for an hour..."" Referring to us walking in at 9:30 and they closed at 11:30. Got one round of drinks and she never came back. We asked the bar back for our check. And while we waited we had cockroaches pass us by.

"I won tickets from komp radio station and was really impressed with the show. We thought it may be cheesy and didn't really have high expectations but it was soo good. The performers did have some resemblance to the actual musicians. The best part was their voices, the dancers and choreography, and the band. I would recommend this show to locals and tourists alike! Something for everybody!:)","2013-08-09","0","8fYvO8ZMILIlPcYNB9IA1w","-67oCytJCBR4x1atdwn7ug"
"We went here after our business was turned away from the silverton because my 10 year old daughter was not allowed in despite kids of hotel guests being  present. The silverton was a total dud compared to m resort. Love the treatment we received as locals. The infinity edge pool was awesome. Was not insanely packed like strip pools and family friendly. Free for locals on friday before noon. Well definitely return!:)","2013-08-09","0","OktwRjOI1nCaq5_AJMWWDQ","-67oCytJCBR4x1atdwn7ug"

"We tried cafe zupas today and very pleased with the service, food, and price. The peanut thai sandwich was really yummy. Had the enchilada soup which was very flavorful.

I had the Galbi and Bibim Naengmyeon (spicy cold noodles)  combo... Enjoyed all of it. Happy tummy :) Soondubu (spicy soft tofu stew) had a great kick.. so good! And Al Chigae (spicy fish egg soup) was also quite seoulful ;)) Open late for midnight korean cravings. I approve :D","2013-08-22","1","xVlj8zOeyGMXpZpdbJj7Rw","HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA"
"Get the Oxtail Pho! So soothing and delicious. Love the broth! Make sure they give you the sides for pho to add in. We didn't get ours until the owner noticed after getting our pho. Shaken beef was on the salty side, but was tender and flavorful. Lotus Root Salad was unique and refreshing. Make sure if all in your party orders hot tea that you request the tea pot! We all ordered hot tea, but instead of getting the tea pot we received individual tea mugs and was charged for each.","2014-02-03","0","Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ","HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA"

"GREAT cheap eats here! They have a 3 Soft Tacos with a drink special that is not only cheap ($7.65 + tax), but absolutely delicious! For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would eat at a Taco Bell when they have Pepe's Tacos--for starters,  the ingredients are fresh here, and I KNOW that the meat I'm eating is REAL chicken. You can see the cooks preparing the food, and they not only offer the common fountain sodas, but the cool horchata, jamaica, and pina drinks.","2014-08-18","0","Qor28v4BlhSwtN8DSvah9g","jvmKUjbMarAMRFoxousQAQ"
"Service is terrible.  Went in to watch a preseason football game. Now preseason games don't count, so it wasn't crowded at all. They had a waitress for the floor, and one bartender. I sat down at a side counter, close to the big TV,  waited 10-15 minutes,  and no one came by. I then went up to the bar, and made eye contact with the two servers. NEITHER OF THEM ACKNOWLEDGED ME. Watched the ENTIRE first half without ANYONE asking for my order, then left. No problem--never going back there.","2014-08-22","0","MWyv0delstZwPcBkGzmwbA","jvmKUjbMarAMRFoxousQAQ"

I can go other places to get the same gas cheaper than what they offer on their 20 cent discount.  I would bring both my vehicles here every week. Not anymore.

"Ive been to Applebee's on numerous occassions, but this is my first review.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm giving them an 8.  Why an 8, my steak was a little undercooked.  I asked for my steak cooked medium and when it came to the table it was medium rare.  But, I wasn't freaked out because I'm use to eating medium rare steaks.  Overall the service was stellar, and my steak had a really good flavor.  So an 8 is definitely appropriate.","2014-01-26","0","66jwLkSd6M0cZulZrA3zcw","FR3yOFal7e5u93WRhML4NQ"

"One of my favorite thai restaurants. I've been coming here for 15+ Years and I'm still coming !! Probably been here over 300 times. 

My favorite dishes are Mongolian beef, chicken fried rice,chopped chicken chili mint , tom Kha, and lemon chicken. You can't go wrong with these dishes. I've referred these to people that are first timers and I've yet had anyone disagree.

For vegetarians my friend gets Clear broth vegetable soup. And she says it's really good","2016-11-20","0","dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ","hr9a1Jml2q1bYI068b77ig"

At this point, this place is a complete unknown. The OB beer is cold so that's a good start....  The food was interesting,  the spicy pork was tasty. The bulgogi soup had four different types of mushrooms in it and had a wonderful broth.

When we ordered my mother ordered the junior baconator. . The cashier was busy All the pictures of the burgers displayed had lettuce tomato and onion. Not this one. Service was slow. The food was mediocre. Fries were a bit cold by the time the burger arrived and a bit soggy.
