It was also very tough and flavorless. I thought I couldn't go wrong with mashed potatoes and gravy, but I was wrong. The gravy was runny and lacked flavor.

"I'm a regular here but ever since they remodeled they changed the way they do things. For example, they used to give the shots to your animal or dog anyway right in the room with you present. Now they weigh and do everything In the back room where eyes can't see. I liked the old way better. So I can see the actual weight on the scale and see my dog getting the 3 shots that I paid for. Not that I don't trust but it gives me piece of mind. Can they start doing this again? Does anyone else agree?","2015-04-22","0","EFPrQuqF0qMit_iCpVa-6A","8cV9qy8BFUDu6VXrni9v6w"

"I'm surprised about the negative comments my experiences here have been nothing but positive!! They have a new service writer Steve and he was great. He stayed on the phone for over 30 minutes trying to get through to my extended warranty company and when he finally did he ""fought"" for me to get certain things covers did the work on car sooner than promised AND gave me rides home and back to pick up car VERY SATISFIED!","2014-01-11","0","DjrN4zlAbJZBbRQxvAUElA","UDKqdVT0FrpL19shSOqgow"
"Terrible. My friend got a burger  ordered MR but so thin didn't matter!! It was WELL. I Asked for a tad extra cheese on my omelette but didn't expect the mound I did get.

"Best car service in town! I started coming to this location as they work with my auto warranty. I have since moved across town and can go to any Sun Auto location but I choose to keep coming here. The staff here is always polite, honest, and eager to help. I have never felt ""raked over the coals"" as I have with other auto repair facilities. I would highly recommend Sun Auto Service on west Tropicana and Fort Apache to any one.","2016-09-17","0","UPmIFPMXhnfHDkaH9YzrlQ","RriVaaiGNecAjJ7O8Vz74g"

The next year after eating the wonderful Wagyu steak and the great service I moved them up to 5 stars.

"Nothing special. We ordered wayy too much takeout and I ended up eating one heck of a delicious & peppery egg roll. The house chicken had great
 flavor but ended up soggy from all the liquid, the orange chicken tasted exactly like a melted pen (weird comparison but my hubs agreed), hot and sour soup that was raaaaved about on yelp was full of tofu and not much else, and you couldn't upgrade the worthless white rice for fried or Lo mein so we had to order.

"1st time visiting this store today. Found some good stuff, but like the other reviews indicated...most of the stuff is worn or picked over.  HOWEVER, if you DIG, you can find some deals. I got a Chantelle bra for $3.97 (originally $80 in the store), a awesome pair of Steve Madden's for $18 which retailed for $148, a Ted Baker wallet for $24 (retailed for $150) & a pair of UGG slippers for $29!!!! Retailed for $140! I saw an awesome pair of Jimmy Choos for $99, but a lady got to them before me.","2013-04-13","0","lwC0U4xU7T2qyCBRmrWFXQ","k6kdX62lIAYDZq-AFwb2pA"

Also, buy your own inner tubes at the local CVS, Walgreens or Target for $4-$6 & fill them up with air for free at the tube shop near the lazy river.

The staff treated you like you were important and really took the time out to make sure i was having a great time.  They are also doing a locals program that with my new vip card , I get half off drinks and comp bottles of hierarchy vodka on Tuesdays.  They also do something called local love,  it gives me bottles of liquor for 150 bucks through out the week.  This place is special.

"Don't expect a good user experience at this restaurant they have clearly got more attitude than they deserve. I made 2 trips to try the restaurant The only reason was at the restaurant was to try the burger Bobby Flay won the South Beach burger contest and i was told i couldn't have it. The second time I was told I couldn't get a seat for two hours when they had no reservations booked......they had SUCH attitudes! !!

We have only been here a few minutes but here are a few of our suggestions: 1) bring\/wear sunscreen and hat ; 2) bring a chair and\/or scout out a spot in the shaded dining tent; those spaces are going to go fast; 3) they do not have any festival maps to show you where each truck is located, so you have to just walk around and check it all out; 4) Hydrate!!

"I used to be proud of Shooters, being the lone survivor of when The Flats collapsed more than ten years ago.  But not now.  It costs $10 to park, and if you arrive after 8, there is a cover charge.  So, for a party of four, it could easily cost you $30 just to get in the door.  It is at a very nice location, the architecture is very nice, and the scenery is great, but the clientele are now middle-age frat-boy boat owners.  You know the type.  I've given up on the place.","2015-08-01","0","gUR2pWQKLPgMEm_R_aI_aw","vhIvwYuEeRvU354jYILIYA"
"My wife and I used to love to come here back when it was The Garage, and we were we even excited when we saw that they had expanded into three total storefronts!  Yay!

But, wait.  It obviously wasn't due to a home-grown grass-roots business doing well.  Some company came in and obviously renovated the place into a pretentious and sterile restaurant bar - which is a far cry from it's original spirit.

No smoking outside?  Seriously?  Then, never mind.  I'll go to The Old Angle across the street.","2015-08-01","0","liPSeXaAfv8jxRGJ717VmQ","vhIvwYuEeRvU354jYILIYA"

The valet took forever, they tried to hike our rate so we had to spend a handful of time proving we got an email confirmation on the original price because the manager was not around. There is no hot tub even though they advertise that they have one. Finally, the valet scratched the car, denting the license plate and then denied it was them.

Once in the cryochamber, you remove the robe and hand it out to top to the operator who stays in the room and talks to you the whole time. These gals are so helpful at distracting you from the cold temperature and give you updates on time remaining if you wish. 3 minutes is the max per session so it is a super quick way to feel great","2015-10-25","0","mt33K_cBxm91YObHKSg4bQ","cz-cyK4tyPbJP5C65p75PA"

"I booked LVH on Hotwire and they gave it 3.5 stars, so I was confident it was gonna be nice, but it wasn't.  The first room was smoking and it smelled disgusting. They moved us to a non-smoking room by the elevator, which we had hear all night. Went to take a shower, the tub was dirty and the water wouldn't turn on, the knob was broken. They could've moved us the next day, but we would've had to wait all day for a new room. I already saw two rooms and they were both unappealing.

"This is the first and last time I will ever stay at this hotel.   Although the beds are comfortable and the monorail stops here that's where the niceties end.  Everything was an extra charge even coffee in the room every single day and I don't mean room service. Room service is minimal and they shut down all the restaurants and  room service early and you're left with eating at a deli for dinner if you don't eat early.  It might seem like a good deal but trust me..... Stay somewhere else!","2013-12-26","0","LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg","jUueRjWUWVS8KUmJcyDQqA"

"A few tips before I write my review:

1) If you are sitting in Section 301 (front row couch seats) be prepared to literally get wet near the end of the show.

2) If you are looking to get danced on by the guys the tables behind the couches seemed to get a lot of action.

3) If you are considering meet and greet just know you only get 4 dancers and you use only one person's phone\/camera in your party for pics.

4) The steps leading down to the showroom are steep!  There is an elevator though.","2017-07-19","0","IymKoL6rgLy6UPyyi7mBlQ","KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg"

"Pros
-The suite has a roomy luxurious feel, with a european decor
-In-suite dining was delicious and beautifully presented
-The hotel in general is clean and full of life
-Free wi-fi! Great reception in the whole hotel

Cons
-Pullout bed is shit. You can feel the springs and you don't even get a blanket, only a thin sheet of linen...
-Room service: it took 4 phone calls and over an hour to receive some pillows

Overall
A lovely hotel with some small negative factors. RECOMMEND:)","2013-06-14","0","Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJ-ZimtnA","EiueDqul3iPbloawObw3jQ"

"Don't be surprised to see these cute animals in your room. Room service sucks in this hotel. Room doesn't have a single drawer. I purchased my vacation directly from Venetian and I am not coming here back again. I decided to reserve this hotel after I heard about the Renovation recently. I usually stay at Bellagio where I always stay happy. The casino in Venetian is 5 times smaller than Bellagio's casino. Casino is not as clean . Room service sucks. Sorry but Venetian is not better than 3.5 hote","2013-12-23","0","Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJ-ZimtnA","JqEHyGNJRROQyhKPKHsrFg"

"U won't enjoy the filet mignon if u like ur steak to be tender, melt-in-ur-mouth and not overcooked. They use charcoal so the exterior of the steak is always burnt. The lobster bisque and pecan pie are  superb, which is pretty much the highlight of this meal. Don't be fooled by the positive review on the steak and don't raise ur expectation. Also, the service is very good, you will enjoy your time there.","2013-07-08","0","--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw","rFO5MQJfYHangqJoWfl2ng"

HOWEVER... Not the airport's fault, but if you're travelling to the US, US customs here is TERRIBLE and ""notoriously difficult"" in the words of an immigration lawyer. They can't handle peak volumes so expect a 2 hour wait over Christmas holidays and absolutely no interest in whether you get to your flight in time.

The hostess though who took us to our seat, didn't smile, didn't greet us, didn't say anything at all. She looked like she was super annoyed at her job and it was around 11:30 am which was still early. We asked for a high chair for our child and she just handed it to my husband. She didn't make the effort to tAke some chairs away to make space for the high chair. It was pretty rude.","2016-02-28","0","4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw","LCFoA50ypQoXmkxip469yA"

It felt like sipping a very sweet, thick syrup so it'll be better with an extra shot & some club soda. ;) A security guard came over to check IDs of my friends & I sitting at Chandelier's 2nd floor bar. It was kinda strange since we're all over 35. Guess we look THAT good!","2013-07-01","0","Pob7ibbNT29--69nxXEP2g","0ARt3gOSMMLz9bmQi8mHEw"
"My 1st time having Malaysian! Yes, they have Malaysian iced tea!!! Lol Funny when the server corrected us once more when we compared similarity to Thai\/Indian. I'm sure Malaysian cuisine will be recognized by mainstream crowd someday... The service was great & very attentive, but the portable air conditioner\/fan wasn't facing us. The humidity definitely felt like a FULL Malaysian experience esp with the awesome island mural on the wall! Food is o-k. Maybe worth a visit, just ask for hot sauce!","2013-07-01","0","X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ","0ARt3gOSMMLz9bmQi8mHEw"

Walked in our room on West Tower the air conditioner was on high (thank goodness because temp was 108).  We were lucky that pur room was nice! I read the  poor reviews about the food and I did not eat there because I was not going to gamble with my health. So we ate a the Wynn Buffett and MGM!

"Came here at 5pm Saturday. Had a travelzoo voucher and used it for the seafood buffet--otherwise would not come here. Most of the seafood was WAY overcooked. Shrimp pasta and teriyaki chicken were amazing as were the prime rib and kalbi ribs. Crab legs were good (the legs, not claws, were very sweet) and so was the chocolate mousse. Desserts left much to be desired other than the chocolate mousse and apple pie...the creme brulee was so liquidy (no crunchy brulee top) that we thought it was flan.","2013-06-15","1","Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A","X9YSE-x0ZjwgKDbrsITyXQ"

Gotham (Pepperoni. sausage, Salami, and Mozzarella), Margherita (Tomato. Mozzarella, and Basil), and North Beach (clams, Mozzarella, onions, and Oregano). They were all tasty but my fav was the North Beach. My only complaint was that there needed to B more clams; only person per slice :(

"Best bang for your buck: the ""restricted view"" seats in section 203, row P.  There is a metal hand rail towards the bottom of your field of view, but it doesn't really affect your view of the show (if you're short, ask for a booster - even for adults!). You are smack dab in the middle of the theatre! Tickets right beside you are $70+ more!  $109 vs 181!! (note: the row O restricted tickets will obstruct your view significantly).

Not sure if they changed management or ownership but the last few months it has really been disappointing. 

I was a huge fan of their vodka sauce. Well it does not taste the same. It appears they changed their product.  

I also don't like how there portions are inconsistent. One day it's a lot of pasta and on other days its a small portion.

"The most helpful tip: Do NOT go here! The lady at the desk was immensely rude, she told me that if I wanted to mail a box I would have to purchase a 5 dollar roll of tape, regardless if there were dozens of people using tape on the counters already. She took my own mail out of my hands, without permission, and proceeded to ""self weigh"" it, telling me how much it would cost. I walked out livid, I'd never go back. They take people out of line, let other people cut in line, I waited 20 minutes.","2014-05-02","0","pw9GYnVXLEN2LkLJMV3NtA","59bTLakzXimME61GuLoBpA"

"Driving down the strip during night time is the worse! It'll take you half an hour just to get to the other end, if not longer! Day time is alright but watch out for taxis as they think they own the road! I suggest to walk to get around and wear comfy footwear. Of course, you'll still find girls trying to walk the walk in heels. Pshh, good luck! They have LV strip maps available in all casinos\/resorts for free. I'd take one just in case.","2015-12-13","0","I6ICIIZfZsp_J9hHmfhWhQ","X0Kf2g4NMYsRjWQ0QeNm0A"

"Those little rubber things they give you when you check-in are finger pot holders for the little hot plates.  It was a hit or miss on some of the food items here, I had the Half sliced crab legs and they were sweet, but I could not really pin point any one item that was particularly noteworthy during our visit, We did enjoy the garlic asparagus salmon and miso seabass and their cheesecake lollipops.","2014-05-12","0","RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g","Eu8oQQBbesupLbf-73bKZg"

"Sides were good but the brisket wasn't real BBQ. It's cooked in an oven, they don't have\/use a smoker so it just tastes like cooked meat. I had chopped brisket. It filled us up but I don't think they should call this a ""BBQ"" restaurant if it's really that different. It wasn't cheap either. We ordered two 1 meat combos w\/ potato chips & a drink and 2 sides each and it came to $32. We were in a rush to get somewhere & this stop was convenient, but I don't think I'd go back again.","2016-06-20","0","EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw","3tLPT5PzOemSed-ERxwSQg"

"James L,

Giving a place a 1 Star without trying the excellent food is a bit arrogant.  The folks at Caffe Boa are always fun and accommodating. If it's a delicate constitution you have that cannot take a bit of sarcasm, I suggest a little hide toughening. It makes life so much easier to deal with.","2017-11-20","0","vrpW_ZIjHvsAX3ByyeHjCA","biEG1IIH2vidy2fmVwIuIQ"

"Being an avid sushi foodie from California, I must admit the fish is indeed sushi-grade and fresh (as in 2-days from catch to door)! The fish is not ""fishy!"" And the crab and lobster are real, not imitation. The sauces are chef-created. The other unique things about this place is their moist, nutty brown rice, they have toppings galore, carry Karma Cold-Pressed Juices. And? they will have Hawaiian Shaved Ice (that tastes like ice cream) and a full bar by Cinco de Mayo weekend.","2017-05-02","0","EpPOZAG0u7qHP-jv5HjFUg","EvPIHxrIba_KEFkpJG1dzw"
