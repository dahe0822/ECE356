"Gary's great! Once again on our annual trek to Burning Man and we had the usual cross country problems with the trialer, as soon as we got into Vegas we called Gary and he came right out to our hotel! 20 mins to get there and 30 mins to check our running lights and repack our bearings on both sides! Honest, friendly, and reasonable! Who can beat that! This may be our new tradition, calling Gary to give the trailer the once over before we get on playa!","2014-08-18","0","uYT-3YKSurVVixHNkhfTqQ","naB-0VPvCnsjwJqlVVR-9w"

They said it'll be ready in a few since they have someone else in the back packaging it.. totally inefficient! The box looked nice but they put the cake in the same box as the cannoli so it got really messy!!

"My ""tip"" is to stay away from that pharmacy. just left there.  my second trip today.  first time they have a wrong phone number and I've been going there for YEARS.  Second trip for a new med and I simply asked if it was ok to take it without eating and because I could tell the kid was too lazy to ask the pharmacist, he tells me ""it doesn't matter ""but when i looked on the label it says ""take with food "".

Worried that the halibut wasn't going to be enough food, I ordered the Lobster Mac-n-Cheese. Maybe my palette isn't developed enough to be critiquing high-end food but the whole dish tasted too lobster-y. Borderline fishy. Same with the Lobster Bisque soup that we ordered.

"Pot Tea has exceptional customer service. Five out of five stars! I had the Spicy Beef Hot Pot, Chicken Wings, and Milk Tea with Boba. The hot pot has a little bit too much going on - there are too many flavors in the pot that don't belong with each other. Other than that, chicken wings - juicy, milk tea - creamy deliciousness.","2014-07-20","0","tA5mqEP68qjbTFK9c14D7A","s1S5Z30mZPwN7-gFGgDa5A"

"Great delivery place for OneLV area.  $3.50 delivery charge.  Most nights until at least 10:30. Their web site needs pix.  I've found there is a lot of discrepancy in Las Vegas chinese food,  like jalapeño pepers and mushrooms where you wouldn't expect it.  Chop Stix was spot on though.

"Wow. Service was horrible! !! Young kids working behind counter on cellphones drinking beverages. Not knowing their own menu.  The chicken was old! The over hyped boneless chicken was hard and dryed out! Spent $39.45 on the worse meal ever from there. Also the kids working the counter were not friendly never smiled.

I also get gel on my hands and feet, sometimes I get the 3D Art Deco designs and always a pedicure; the prices are incredible.","2014-03-26","0","hD1dmFinKHtz6FgVEINRgg","YjLhBgezVRZqbXhIsnfgMA"

"Got the Pad Thai & Pad Woon lunch specials. I also got the Pad See Ewe with beef. No complaints on lunch service.  I have two complaints about pad see ewe: it was too salty, oily and it had broccoli, not Chinese broccoli. The chef probably doused it with soy sauce & didn't bother tasting the dish before it was boxed up for me. I prefer Chinese broccoli with this dish, as it has a fresh vegetable taste rather than the microwave steamed taste & then dryly thrown into the pad see ewe.","2013-05-02","0","jc4Wlgme6xI0-c1U_AKuBQ","AnEOerkVdenyLRpYShBHaQ"

"Beautiful design...ugly nails. Andy does lovely designs but other than that my full set was terrible. Best described as ""chiclets"" they were flat, thick, wide and poorly shaped. Started lifting after a week. Another lady did my pedi and it was hurried. Didn't pumice or clean under my nails. I guess you need to upgrade for them to spend longer than 18 minutes. They were friendly, but I won't return.","2014-04-30","0","FU5SxmPvQsAw6t_S1vTlBA","E3Q7cXpAF2TK7sAXynoJtw"

"Noticed this place is kinda inconsistent with boba. One day ill come ill get a drink and it will be super good the way I want it then one day it wont be good. Same thing with the boba sometimes its to soft as if they just leave it there sitting all day. For example when I get the mango green tea sometimes its delicious and sometimes its hardly sweet.. its strange. But they have good music and people are friendly also a lot of room. Just kinda disappointed to be honest.","2017-08-07","0","rqWIntPaV8TpJvgT6H9UNw","kbJeRTki8F984KdOlibxzA"

I felt bad for not bringing in much cash $10.00 tip is what they deserve but I didn't have much but I know next time I'll be ready and know who to ask for. I believe her name was Anna or Shana?

"Do not come in between 7-8. That's when shifts are over. Your wait will be looooong if you don't check in on line. Don't be surprised if you stand for a while before being acknowledged.

"So, I wanted to give this place a try. I wanted to order a large pizza but the lady who didn't greet me told me I should get a ""medium"" & I told her its for a family of 5 & she said it has 8 slices. Obviously, with her unpleasant response I declined to get a ""large pizza"" ( which would have been a better profit for the pizza place) so...I went with the medium. If it wasn't for that, or if I had a different person to service me, I would come back. Now I hope the pizza makes up for it.","2013-07-17","0","I0f12eU-xFn6Kd_4H57jrQ","2K9euYBrRA0l0JbGay4SJg"

"If you have someone at home before ordering, have them pre-heat the oven to 425 degrees, so it's ready to bake once you get home. Oh and it is perfectly fine to put the pizza in the oven with their Bake and Serve Tray. **yes, it's Important to read the directions first** After 10 mins, the tray can be carefully removed for a crispier crust. And then place cooked pizza back on the tray to serve. Enjoy the savings now through the 19th of January.","2014-01-16","0","LRWM3vktESJJEYpBs-_x4g","2K9euYBrRA0l0JbGay4SJg"

"We had late night craving the other night and since not much is open, we decided to order from Napoli. Reviews aren't that good and is only 3 stars but to my surprise, the wings are the best i've had in Vegas so far.

At the district it is cheaper (under $40 for the biggest package), the Santa is very personable \/doesn't rush you and they even let you take as many pictures as you want with your own camera.

Seems prices keep climbing and the talent stays the same.

This is NOT my fave place to go, however it's fine to go to in a pinch for my kids.

"This was my second time in this shop. The staff is very helpful with the questions that I have had. They customize the flavor and nicotine strength while you wait if needed. They sell straight 18mg nicotine, but will modify to more or less depending o. Your needs!

Pizza was soggy and burnt. The cook just kept looking at the bottom  and when he felt it was done, he pulled it.

Make sure when you order you say ""just egg, sausage and cheese on hamburger bun"". Take note, they cook it when you order so the wait maybe a few minutes. It's not under heat lamps.","2015-12-10","0","6EWqsE6Ojvt-FA-rl8Sm4Q","quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw"

"I have visited since my last review. And again, never disappointed. I love the staff, there professionalism. The staff and there knowledge of wine and food is always on point. I over heard the manager explaing to some staff about presentation and why its to be that way. I serve in a restaurant and Allthough I like my job, everytime i visit here i tend to be envious of the way the staff is working together and the support of the management. Food is good, good price but i come for the staff.","2016-10-15","0","QsKhwKYB3YeWXqpIPd5QMg","T3xAfs0iXNWX-epchW6Fog"

"Henderson Chevrolet is a ""**** show"" to say the absolute least! Horrible, awful, absolute **** customer service from everyone on the floor to upper management. The techs apparently know absolutely nothing, per there service manager, or head of maintenance. 

After months of trying to fix an issue, being told finally that you have to come in and get a new car because they can't fix the problem, then days later they ""fixed"" it... what a joke!

"You've gotta be really hung over to want this food. Gross. The fish tacos have rancid cabbage, and rubbery ""fried"" fish. The waiter then proceeded to tell me that is how cabbage smells... Um, I do my own grocery shopping which sometimes includes cabbage- and it doesn't smell as pungent as this ever. Ya. There's a reason everyone has such poor reviews.","2013-04-27","0","zwddv6HjTjDx9fOr3MFtwQ","BqfuGe5WArDlecdotCE7WA"

"Our first time here and most definitely our last . To order is very confusing it looks one line where  you start from the beginning but technically it's three different ordering stations we waited in line then found out after waiting over five minutes to get a bowl is on the section to the left. The two front cashiers are extremely rude my wife asked them a question and they told her to relax after asking a very simple question.  They play Mexican music extremely loud. It's fine but just to loud","2014-08-08","0","TCoBE_BkDRrK0bWrh5VueQ","8pCIHzW1SiGg7rLXTxjd9g"

They really know how to treat their customers and the quality is spot on.. Clean & organized salon. Pleasant atmosphere and I will give them 10 stars if I could. Thank you Tony for staying are to accommodate my schedule.. Hannah did a fab job on my fingers and toes today!!!

From day one, it's been problem after problem. Never Infiniti again. Look at all of my reviews.

"Be careful of the atms. Not only do they have a sneaky 15% added fee for every transaction but each one I went to mysteriously jammed 2 of the bills of the stack I withdrew BOTH times. And that was before I even actually spent a dollar at all. I guess that was good though because when I realized this, that was my cue to leave before I spend anymore. 

Best tip : Go for the music and vibe and don't even try to talk to anyone. They will take your money before YOU even get to see it.","2014-10-11","0","Ql_yYull9tglbdsiNZcJiA","FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA"
