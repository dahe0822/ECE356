"I ordered the ""Canoewreck,"" one of the all-day breakfast items and one of only a couple of vegetarian items. It seemed heavy on the filler carbs, with two full slices of heavily buttered toast and lots of potatoes in the tofu hash.  It also was quite salty. I would have been glad to have less toast and more fruit (the tiniest slice of pineapple, cantaloupe, and orange - hidden under all that toast). Plus it seemed a bit pricey for the amount of actual hash it offered. Won't order that again.","2013-10-28","0","_5PJ4GHIXNdUdXtohylKGQ","AlKwXxhPdj5bkdYDRO7gtw"

I think he honestly was just having a bad day and needed someone to be unkind to because the things he was saying to me didn't even make sense.

"Good food, good value. Busy for weekday lunch but not packed. Ask for the WiFi code. Menu is a bit overwhelming for newbies  (but only in terms if what tastes best with what). Got a great, filling, fresh, healthy, spicy and flavorful bowl plus a bottle of water for $8.50. I like it hot and mine was plenty spicy for sure (in a good way!). 4.5\/5 stars.","2013-06-27","0","yBbqFPuwFiaom435KOY4cg","s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w"

"$10 min for CC. $3.25 for a small (2-scoops, 1-2 flavors, cup or cone). SO good. A ton of unique, ever-changing flavors (a la Jeni's, but more fun). Cocoa Puffs ice cream was awesome, as was everything else we tried. Made on premises, very fresh.

"Cool joint! Tiny place, hip, very casual, cheap. Tacos & burritos are huge. Get 1 taco + split a small chips\/vegan guac and you're set. Get a side sauce or 2, not a ton of flavor naked. Everything was great, especially the citrus cilantro sauce and homemade lemonade (especially with a shot of Absolut!) Wish they had the fish tacos everyday in the summer instead of only Friday. Great craft beer & liquor selection with fun signature drinks. Pigged out + alcohol for about $25 for 2. We'll be back.","2013-06-29","0","WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg","s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w"

"We've been customers of theirs ever since they operated out of their house in Twinsburg. Their popularity has made them expand into a store. Don't worry about the location. The wait time for the food is a necessity. Everything is made from scratch! If I had to recommend one thing, it would be extremely difficult. The chicken tikka masala, the goat, the butter chicken, the paneer dishes, malai kofta, poori, everything is really good and authentic! Highly recommend calling ahead for pickup.","2015-11-13","0","xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw","pNMgOtz1YsU4pjch3qPT2g"

"They also have a Jacuzzi hand wash.

Feels like a Chipotle, love the fact that the kitchen is completely encased in glass.  Apparently this is not a chain; at least not yet.  Everything is fresh.  Very tasty.  The price point is definitely higher than Chipotle.  Definitely not American size portions, smaller portions.  Apparently built on the  site of an old GM Saturn show room.  The owners also own five (5) Five Guys.  Very high traffic, very high congestion at the CHAGRIN entrance.","2014-12-21","0","NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg","q1N0Z9oljcrhpEnXIO3fLA"

"Completely disgusting. The building is a complete slum. A real shame. Used to be nice. Bugs everywhere. A completely disheartened staff. Can't even get into the garbage room. The gym is a complete disaster. Check it out for yourself, and make sure you talk to a resident before you decide to move.","2014-04-04","0","ehbIeIDIUWk_XEB0LdddAg","bvST_4cmIe9qXCebHHGB7A"
"I just broke my lease yesterday and would have paid a million dollars to do so. The place is a hot mess, smelly, dirty, something is always broken (elevators, lights, fire alarms, etc). They have lost 90% of my packages, all together worth hundreds of dollars. When you do try and tell them about your problems the management barely listens and surely does not do anything about it. Security is a joke. Hardly ever watching their security cams and letting anyone in. Try ur best to not make this home","2015-12-21","0","ehbIeIDIUWk_XEB0LdddAg","YaMNPU1G2lRLC-kWJIGUsg"

"I'm a gyro fanatic. But sadly, with food, comes service. I ordered my gyro to-go, the bartender was very rude on the phone. We started a conversation while she prepared my gyro. One of the reasons while I'll never give this place my business again is because she asked me if I was ""strong enough"" after I told her my soon-to-be occupation(law school) How rude! My other reason is the bag of chips that came with my gyro was half eaten when I got home. Disgusting!

"It's been a while since we went to Ruby Tuesdays, they revamped the menu. The portion sizes have been cut drastically. I'm a health  conscious person but this was ridiculous . We both had a entree of chicken for 14.00     It was about the smallest piece of chicken we have ever seen. Thought maybe just bad luck but both dishes were the same. Sometimes places go to far and in my opinion this is one time the old menu was better, we won't be back.","2014-12-16","0","yy13WKIxs9Hjwrq40iUc9Q","I-iafiHiDigxZJI0FcXJlQ"

"One of the worst places I've ever been. The food sucked, and not just because everything that was supposed to be hot, came out cold.  It was also really dirty for just opening up an hour before getting there. We did a mixture of dim sum and sushi. The sushi was fresh 3 days ago and mushy. Never once was asked if everything was ok, if we would like a refill or why we had pushed all of our food to the side when we had full plates. I hope we didn't get food poisoning.","2013-11-26","0","zKJ4KcZAfTNBIM7OvkVv3A","dDZVEBf0R45c4OJuWxXexQ"

Our waitress was a rarely around throughout the evening. Too busy?  

When our food arrived via a server, he didn't know who had ordered what. 

I ordered their bacon wrapped filet, and it wasn't delivered with a steak knife. Half way through the meal, our waitress noted this (""Oh, you need a steak knife!""), but never returned with one.

Had walnuts, raisins with a balsamic dressing with grilled chicken. Chicken was perfect: moist inside, grilled outside. All ingredients were fresh. It just didn't have the zing I expected from Gorgonzola. So it was good. Not really good.

I get they're new but my god (shout out to Adam- one of the worst). The place is very well set up and decorated with a nice patio. It's the same owners of blue moose in Parma and barley house on west 6th which makes sense. Bottom line come here for beer skip out on the food though.

"Rental was painless, but upon return, had $15 late fee. No one in our group heard this but that they claimed to have told everyone about. The attraction is to rent bikes, ride north and then ride the train back. Train arrives at 5:05. I would think they would account. Also, rental staff thought it would be a good idea to give me a bike that had a nearly flat tire with the caveat that they just put air in and to come back if it was a problem.

"As a Jewish girl from New York, bialy's are common and delicious. Glad they are offered.
I so wish they offered lox. They offer smoked salmon, big difference. Lox is way more expensive, cured and not smoked but is worth every bite. 
I enjoy their breakfast, the potato pancake, and their fish fry is second to none. 

Almost everything else has suffered due to an over abundance of salt.

"This place is awesome! The best chocolate croissant I've ever had! It was just buttery right.

We had our brunch at this tiny cute place for the first time and hubby and I just fall in love after having a pecan and peach waffle, which was so good. Hubby loved his omelette. 

Okay, about my waffle. I am a big fan of waffle and have actually found a great place to have it. I usually like it a bit crispy but the one I had today was really flavory.

We'll be back again for sure!","2013-06-23","0","IXXERocY1bqGwRllcy8J2w","I2OXWsGgBpmSAgeU43nuDQ"

We had a great cocktail shrimp and fruits de mer as our appetizers. The latter came in a huge portion but so good. 

Out tips: if you don't drink alcohol like us, they have the best Mexican coke- which is way better than any other coke I've ever had! Also, if you wanna save some money but still want to have some delicacy, the appetizer is more than enough.

Ps. We brought our main dishes home as we were still full from the appetizer.","2013-06-23","0","d6VYQbeTZ_WdD8Uuhh35dg","I2OXWsGgBpmSAgeU43nuDQ"

"Not quite authentic Indian food. And the waiters will tell you...
It's tempered down and most dishes are quite creamy. 
You can order your dish hot which is too hot for most to handle. Or medium or mild which will suit most tastes. 
I suspect lost people here who loved the food also love creamy sauces. 
The service was fast and good.  Place was clean. 
Bon appetit!","2013-08-11","0","cJLx99fsYPM0SlNfWLb4Ug","zANgvkoDaLGRoJgvLvg_vQ"

"Enjoyed a beautiful day on the patio listening to the Blue Olives (they're great!) and sipping beer. Ordered the nacho's and was fully disappointed-a somewhat small pile of flavorless corn tortillas and minimal cheese, chicken, peppers, and a clump of black olives. It appeared to have been placed briefly under a hot broiler as the top was charred and any buried shredded cheese was unmelted. The result was a very dry dish that required multiple cups of salsa to provide flavor and moisture.","2013-06-26","0","xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA","VvwrCpL2_uMrRumFWo7nLQ"
