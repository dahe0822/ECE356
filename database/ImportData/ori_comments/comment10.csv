So we ordered those in chicken and beef. Not surprised they were really good with lots of chicken and shredded beef and still juicy unlike other taco shops that skimp on the meat and dry out after frying. The best part were the lengua (beef tongue) tacos. Huge chunks of meat and huge flavor!!!  We'll be back!","2013-09-20","1","P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww","WXAdkvgUwCU5Sk-F1zlcMA"

"This pet Salon is just down the street from my house, and so far they are a excellent find. They summer clipped my nervous Corgi, and was returned to me happy. Worth every penny to know your pet is treated kindly, and abused like other pet salons. Everyone is so friendly. Happy to find them.","2013-05-25","1","X4gex5PXp6r7G7-T3hapPQ","Xq7mFu4uuVBnjvdbVWbOpg"
"Great view, terrible food! We were served the saddest looking iceburg salad with watery ranch, and some cold fry bread pucks. We ordered two medium rare NY steak, and they were brought to us cold, well done, with over cooked veggies. At this point I'm so hungry I want to cry. The waitress took back our steak, commenting that maybe the restaurant was too dark for us to see if our steak was medium rare. Really! We walked out. How is this place stay in business? Did I mention the smelly bull!","2013-07-20","0","KFAJsmQ6GnHxyfmv16s9VA","Xq7mFu4uuVBnjvdbVWbOpg"

I returned the next week and mentioned last week I was missing items the week before and told (by the same rude employee) ieverything is there.

"They are good businessmen who will brainwash you to take personal training and once you fall for it they would stick a contract in such a way that you cannot come out of it... You need to buy yourself out of contract paying half the amount of the contract period which is a hefty money. No matter what issues you have, you wouldn't be understood  and they will throw the contract terms on u rather than understanding.

My piece of advice don't take personal training here.","2015-07-29","0","8ybZDBHM4-r_O2F7J8zz-w","3E0O__V4fnQk3d4jYZVsHg"

In the past they have confirmed your order as they gave it to you which was a great thing, but no longer. Now they give it to you in a mystery bag which you could either check it (which takes even more time) or roll the dice and (most likely) not have an item ordered.

"Haven't been to native in awhile and decided to try them out again. My stepfather and I ordered drinks and it took 15 minutes to bring out..once we got them, we tasted it and the margaritas we ordered were more water than alcohol. The zucchini appetizer was small for the cost. The wings were okay. The waiter we had was especially rude once we pointed out that they charged full price for our drinks instead of the happy hour price. I don't think we will be back again..","2016-05-10","0","B7lWxgPmJPJJ7Mz2OL6aAg","on_6KZ9WpwztOg_bCX4yCg"

Not a single one of these jobs starts under $1,000, and many go up as high as $20,000.

It is extremely foul smelling and unlawful for salon use. In its liquid state, the chemical is proven to be unsafe.

"Diner-style, 48 seat, burger joint tucked into a strip mall at Lindsey and University. Positives: Good burger! Food prepared fresh. Fresh ground beef, crisp, cold lettuce and tomato. Quick service. Older, two person staff kept busy, sharing both counter and grill work. Fresh carnations distributed around the 6 booths, 8 deuce tops and 8 seat counter. 
Negatives: Few smiles from staff. Communication brusque. Benefit of doubt: Maybe due to natural temperament as activity was still  energetic.","2014-05-10","0","iJBnqweAPDTCfyMcRrG90w","BhEdkt_XVEkNKQqTnNK-kw"

"If you really want to treat you get the Pho.  The fact that the entire soup is made from scratch is unique as other restaurants typically use Amex. What you'll find is you won't walk away with a headache from all the MSG.

What I also like is the service. The owners are small business owners which means that they're here to help and please. It really makes you feel good when you come in because they remember who you are.","2014-09-29","0","y5X2nO5i_rlqOwwUETwd1Q","qvi0FDVlw8lKZzw5MH2rWg"

"I was in there today with my daughter who happens to be handicapped and we were purchasing some stickers and a scrap book and I realized we were being followed. I wasn't sure why then finally as I'm going to check out the Manager Linda comes screaming at my daughter and I saying we needed to put things back that we weren't purchasing. Mind you this is in front of customers and mortifying in front of my daughter. She began to bang on the glass upon my exiting and yelling hysterically.","2014-07-03","0","17T_6Dx_kgfLEoQFp2UM5Q","5MpRp9s5bPkr2JD37ArPwA"

"There is a very specific window of time where I would highly recommend getting your shopping done at this TJs: right after they open their doors in the morning!

"When I treat myself to a nice dinner I always end up at Charlestons.  Impeccable service, highest quality ingredients, and professionally prepared dishes are the reasons I love this place.  The shrimp cargot is to die for and the center cut filet can be cut with a butter knife.  If they sold lobster, life would be perfect.","2016-06-28","0","nxM6jNyKDgAOh7MAG-VJ_g","ExpyVAl3jHSBbHngCcDDQA"

"The restaurant was very clean and the decor vibrant. The prices where good and made for a cheap lunch for 2. The squid salad was good, but the sushi, for the most part, was bland. There were a couple rolls that were good but most reminded us of pre-prepared sushi you find in grocery stores. 

I love the restaurant's concept, they just need to work on the taste of their sushi.","2013-04-23","0","d7ozMWbBwcFOkHM3zmktfA","tOzylErjY0jP-pULRgBLjQ"

"In almost all cases they cannot hold your vehicle. Go down, ask for your vehicle back, sign the refusal to pay form (they have plenty but they hope you don't know the law), and take your vehicle.

They will lie, threaten you, and call your complex or HOA manager saying you said they will pay it but stay calm.

"My tips to the owners of this establishment- Marinate your meat. Use proper rice for the spam musubi. Lower your price to $1.50 - $2.00 for the spam musubi or put an extra piece in if you're going to keep the price at $3.00. Fry the spam, don't just slice it. Perfect your macorni salad recipe.","2015-10-12","0","-oSII3bw90cvyLmgsHgmpg","aVzsQ7Iu7KbwOdMJGwXU7g"

"Ask for a bra fitting, and what your correct bra style is. If your chest size (measured around the largest part of your chest while wearing your favorite bra)  is more than say 3 or 4"" than your band size (measured the same way as your chest, but just under your breasts),  surely you wouldn't want a thin ""tshirt"" material or ""lace"" cups that won't provide enough support. You would probably want a molded balconette, (my personal fav as a 42F) or something similar; will also help with back pain!","2016-05-26","0","dAOviafTrIZ-t3UDsxj0dw","9dGo-hu8YkWO6KgTU6Huvg"

Book Marriott.com, package with breakfast if you want that at Courtyard, not priceline, etc.   Only Gold & platinum rewards members get free breakfast at courtyard, unless you book that room rate package including breakfast.  People stop complaining when you book thru priceline.

She kept rolling her eyes and huffing and puffing like her life was ruined when I asked her for fountain water instead of bottled water. If it weren't for the awesome ice cream & polite manager that rang me out I would have given the place a 2 star review. One worker can ruin a persons day & badly impact a business. Other then her, Joe's is AMAZING!! Keep up the good work guys.","2015-07-04","0","_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw","I9eKl2XQeg4Z_ukugfpLIw"

He gave me pointers and things to look out for in the future. Considering the house was over 60years old, he knew exactly where to find everything that was original and what has been replaced.I would highly recommend him to anyone. BTW! He's rates were actually about $100-$150 cheaper than the other inspectors.","2014-03-16","0","2fMzt6S7vs0vzDt--8Wm3A","WmqQOHBAqN5CvaVju9J7Tg"

I received a platter of chips, cheese , salsa n an egg prepared over easy.  Looked like a platter of nachos.  They had missed one ingredient...chicken.  They apologized and asked if they could just give me a side of chicken. Then they gave me 20% off of my bill...not sure how I feel about that.  Anyway...just ask questions before you order!","2013-08-11","0","5VXsbrqyJx0a4iaa43RNFA","RAK7ORGqGVrbHZhx-3xyeQ"

"Don't try to return something if you happen to get a discount on a different item in the same transaction... I paid full price for a dress $47.00 and since I got a discount on another shirt for buying 2 things, when I returned the dress I paid full price for they told me they had to take some $$ off what I paid since I got a discount on another shirt.  Also told me it ""wasn't fair"" to them.... Ended up getting $22 in store credit for a dress I paid $47 for.

If he believed that someone was spitting flem in the food he never walked out so I guess it's a flavor he was hoping to enjoy. I know he was disappointed cause although it can get a little messy after a long day. They're open every day from 10:30-10:30. They work very hard and cant clean it all","2015-06-20","0","6N9NClBpOi-GoWckg137NQ","aXpQ9wpQPC7aS-b0BaVUYQ"

When I caught her she turned red in the face and made excuses! My dog never liked going in the door to the place.  Now that I have found a new groomer he's so happy to go and to see her! It just makes me sick that I didn't understand the signs! He always looks perfect when he's done now too :)","2014-06-30","1","i0jiULli2gLvtxzsLDOC-Q","l3bnLIC2zzlELh-kTOUTng"
