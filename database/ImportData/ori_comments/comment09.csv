The service was rather terrible. The woman at the counter seemed annoyed that I was there, and she would not make eye contact. When I got my food, thanked her 3 times before she acknowledged I was even there to get my food.

"This place is straight to the point. I knew my brakes were shot. But never having replaced any ever, I called around different places to get quotes. Everywhere in a 10 mile radius was astronomical. I had taken my car in to Auto Care before & decided to give them another shot as my 1st experience was pleasant. While I still paid a lot, it was literally $300 less than the next cheapest quote I'd already gotten. I had my car back within 3 hours.

Going to Kathryn my main concern was a healthy dog and that's what I got! My Maltese is now over two years old and I've never had to take her to the vet. Kathryn helps with ANY questions I have and explains everything you need to know even years later. I would highly recommend buying from her if you want a beautiful healthy Maltese.","2014-03-29","0","gX126w-SBfFvXfWekeb1SA","pG-0fg0xNjjpWiFjAJN_pQ"

Read your contract very carefully. If you have any questions, you will not be able to find help on the weekends.  Managers are only available during regular business hours on weekdays. 
By the way, the most expensive membership is one you cannot cancel for a year.  It seems that the $10 per month membership, can be canceled with a 10 day notice.

Everything I've had has been tasty and made great leftovers the next day. Can't beat that.","2013-05-20","0","PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg","Y-3rWVzeetMMHzImOz5p7w"

"Excellent food and service. 

Old-world charm, comfortable inside and out on the patio. The patio was like being in Europe. 

Food was perfectly proportioned, and delicious. 

The music was great bossa-nova  and jazz mixes, just the right volume to catch my ear but easily talked over for conversation. 

Would I go back? Yes!

For two 4-course dinners with dessert and three glasses of wine and a cocktail, it was $150-ish, pre-tip. For that we walked away delighted with every aspect of the meal.","2014-02-28","0","PNTyiqS7R-0c1ofxOfDijQ","Y-3rWVzeetMMHzImOz5p7w"

The ""large"" chai latte was a short pour, and what I'd call warm, definitely not hot. I've had two other of the same here before that were better, so the jury is still out on the chai latte.","2013-10-13","0","Wb6Q0YVcNghQ2w20hUYRoA","Y-3rWVzeetMMHzImOz5p7w"

Not only was I %100 satisfied with the great customer service that Tami provided us with but the food was outstanding!! I fully intend on returning to bootleggers and I can't wait for them to take off. I strongly recommend treating yourselves to their phenomenal food selection.","2013-11-07","0","2skQeu3C36VCiB653MIfrw","Zr_nPZHvgUzaLpLJdsGBPA"

"This is a place clearly in decline.  Last visit there was about eight years ago and it was just okay then.  Decided it was time to give it another try.

The sushi from Fry's grocery store is actually a little better.

The decor is suffering, staff are mostly indifferent and it feels like no one there cares any more.

Much better sushi at Yasu Sushi Bistro by Target on Cactus.

That will be our last visit.","2013-06-28","0","dc6sPg9kNliz_Cy2yX19tw","5D1tBZ13vDeQJvR9UXLqBg"

"Strip mall pizza place. Location had a unique mothy ball smell, like a old smell. Odor was hard to miss or forget. 
Restaurant seating up front. Larger bar area in back. Old decor, pink walls and green carpet. 
Several TV's
Attentive staff. They have soft pretzels. Pizza sauce is tasty. 
Chicago style pizza. Little squares. Nice tasting pizza. They advertise live music on Thursday Friday and Saturday nights. 
Outdoor seating also. Overall experience was okay. Probably would not run back","2014-07-20","0","wXXqG4igJeJwL9o5sjyMXQ","zIH-q7hCrOZtBPaeQLvA9A"

"Went today and while I was there a man came up to me while I was vacuuming my car asking to check my windows for cracks.  I said no, just trying to wash my car. The guy then met me at the automated machine where I choose my wash. He did that for me and then told me the machine did not have pennies so it wouldn't have my change...then I go up to the wash and then was asked to buy gift cards. Calm down!

Good food fast.  The bacon was as advertised Yummm.

"My family and I had no choice but to stay here at this motel 6 location because all of the other hotels were booked. Worse choice our  family could have made! First off we requested a non smoking room and that's what we got I had a headache the whole weekend. Secondly there were cigaret burns all over the room including the the T.V. Lastly they have an infestation  of fleas I woke up with several bites. Word of advice never stay here the overall service and vibe of this hotel is sketchy.","2014-03-26","0","5ixDjFTIPdKSjOeos0BYpA","aj-u-c-jlfAJWcy_fDiLFQ"

".. Very good food here .. Chicken cooked  to PERFECTION .. Seasoned nicely as well.  Don't waste your time ordering the tacos or burritos , just go for the half or whole chicken. It's cooked RIGHT.  The beans they serve are the business too. No rice is served here.  You couldn't be disappointed though with the pollo y frijoles  unless you are some sort of jive turkey .. I suggest to order to go ... Parking can get tricky too as the parking lot is rather narrow.","2013-04-11","0","UDucqwO8PwUOwcmUsJ-gOA","OqjUpEmkBii2rna3r8JkQA"

I can't stress this enough...do not take anything to these people. They kept my metal parts (to be chromed) for over a month and when I finally got to pick them up, they damaged one piece and the workmanship on the other pieces were embarrassing. Yet, the lady up front seemed ok with charging and giving me these parts that looked terrible. One piece they pitted and broke some of the welds off. It was suppose to be chrome, but they handed it back to me pitted and scratched.","2013-04-24","0","dn7eR4ID5SRLS6VUzOBsXQ","TCBDkCb7BTyu-d8efpElgA"

"Maintenance team has still not fixed garage door that QA reported broken on July 3rd. Two months is far too long for delayed repairs. They say they are too busy fixing AC units...

"This apartment complex and their management team seem to be ""selective"" in their response to maintenance and repair requests. I moved in July 2013 and as of April 2014 several repair orders that were approved at move-in have not been competed. A fairly major entry door frame and lock repair order approved in January has not yet been competed. Carpeting was worn out at move in and looks horrible. AC is marginal.

"Never again will I eat herefor the half off wings for dine only special for national wing day. Showed up and told it was a 45 minute to an hour wait which is understandable. An hour later we sat down and then was told it would be another 45 minutes to an hour wait for the food. Why didn't the host mention that as well? I would have walked out but since I have invested an hour already and starving I'm getting my damn wings. Eff you BWW.

I overheard a lady who was ahead of me in line (thank you to the lady dressed in white) talking to another passenger that she thinks the line at Gate C should be shorter.

"They did not explain things very well at all and my youngest ended up hitting a wall in the first lap and they kicked her out. When we first signed up to race we said we were NEW and it said NEW on out tickets, but no one said to watch the video (you can't hear it with your helmet in).

"HORRIBLE!!  First impression, the chairs were stained really bad.  I ordered a Ceasar salad, it had hair in it.  The presentation was was not attractive, brought me a ""fresh"" salad, all they did was take the lettuce out that had the hair on it!  Gross!!  My husbands salad was warm, almost hot an looked just as unattractive!  Service was slow, waiter was not excited about the food or the fact he had to work.

"New addition to the menu: Bloom Petals. These are the greatest invention since the bloomin' onion!! A smaller portion of a deconstructed bloomin' onion that serves 2 people! Doesn't get much better than a completely fried onion (no raw sections) with the right amount of sauce!! What about all the leftover fried pieces? Eat them with your hands? Why not use them as a salad topper. Highly recommend this appetizer!","2014-12-01","0","k99YNCx5KcQPR7oeTgAOzg","0T4CQkcKjHtt2g3xvf-b_Q"

"Not so great. I brought my husband for his birthday with higher expectations. Some of the fried components were burnt and greasy. Not typical of the sushi restaurants we frequent. We had four rolls and all were fairly bland and fell apart so not constructed well.

Their chips are good. Crisp and fresh. Salsa was nice and he provided me some house hot sauce to raise the heat a bit.  I tried the Tomatillo sauce at Josh's suggestion and that was tasty and had a nice kick to it.  Their guacamole is good as well.

Service was fine.   Cost was average but not worth stomach issues later.","2014-04-09","0","nztjmkY4LZp18kviHIO7ow","z4IWpQjYbu48FoUMDcHMBw"
