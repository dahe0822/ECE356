"The building is an old converted church so the inside is really awe inspiring. The tacos are a little pricy at $3.95 each but the gourmet flavors are worth it. The chicken is good but a bit bland so it's ""meh"". The lamb and the cherry beefy are outstanding. Although the food lacks much seasoning, it let's the food breathe. chips are warm and fresh and the salsa has a nice little kick. But my favorite dish here is the queso dip. REALLY flavorful. The guacamole needs more seasoning but it's good.","2013-12-07","0","3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ","LZ-dU_13mEQZBHW1AkKOOA"

Waited over an hour for cold satay and a salad with fish that was so greasy it was inedible.  $25 later I canceled the dinner order for fear of how long it would take to get and what it would taste like.

Ordered the veggie roll, soy ramen with a side of veggie salad. Veggie roll tasty as usual.. Not overstuffed with veggies which made my sushi experience light and ready for next plate.

Soy ramen is a lot for one person unless you are really hungry! My wife and I split the noodle soup. 

So heavy and delish once you add that chilli paste.

"If you get the roasted cauliflower and shishito peppers, have the 805 or the pineapple margarita to balance the spice. My ultimate fave is the lobster risotto. They don't spare the lobster or flavor. You can't go wrong with the staff and the lovely remodel.","2017-10-20","0","DpCdZ3EfAoGgJzcvaR0quQ","zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw"
"The lobster risotto is ridiculously not good for your waist but your mouth will love you. If it's available, get the pork chop special and\/or the crispy duck leg. I love everything here including the staff and menu. Oh have a glass of the Taylor Small Batch Whiskey. The remodel is so open and inviting.

1: for the love of Christ- put a spring on the screen door so it stops banging. It's a heavy door and every time someone walks on or out it slams and sounds like a car wreck.

"Gorgeous Dinning rooms and Gorgeous city views. Across from the tallest building in Az and right in the heart of historic downtown Phoenix. Nook has my heart. I love the draft cider here. Only $6 and I can say it's one of the strongest I've ever had, not sweet at all. Goes perfect with the poutine. Order the short ribs on top, they are mouth watering delicious. Defiantly a place for a date night in the city or a Birthday Dinner.
