"Yesterday I was dinning here and all of a sudden I witnessed Anna reprimanding her employee in front of not only the guests but the employees as well. I'm a member of management myself and when I have a problem with an employee I pull them to the side away from everything and everyone. I'm just saying that this action was very unprofessional and im sure that the employee that was being reprimanded was very embarrassed.

We walk in with 17 people and the best they could offer us was the patio. That would have been fine but it was chilly and we asked if there were heaters and the manager stated NO. So we left.

"The sign out front says $28 for an hour and a half (90 min). The lady explained that the first half hour is a foot bath detox. We were both in and out in 65 minutes. The ""detox"" was soaking your feet for 15 min like all the foot spas do.  I go weekly for massages and ended up spending $50 for an hour here when you can go down the street to Good Foot Spa and spend $30 for a full hour with tip. I don't mind spending money for something but don't cheat your customers with your deceptive sign.","2017-05-21","1","oZQhQRDCvhMaOmGcl3FPjg","ziiMYejVJAjbkRjSeAzrbQ"

Ordered up Las Vegas chili dog, with white sage chili, an order of buffalo cheese fries and draft root beer (no frosted glass..bummer). Yeah this will do just fine while I am here in Vegas. Pastrami was tasty, but they cook it on the grill and it dries out a bit. Cali still has the best west coast pastrami hands down on this coast.

I'm not sure you're really coming here for the food but it's all in all decent and not too hard on the pocketbook for a night out in Vegas. 

We had Chicken Rio, lasagna and cannelloni. No one could finish our meals. The table wine that comes with your meal isn't 90point wine but decent enough with dinner.","2017-08-29","0","yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w","c-zf2KZB8xYWugFXx3ZBpg"

Then ask why his business post on the website what a Class A facility is when they clearly are nowhere near a Class A facility. This guy is the biggest clown in town. Biggest scammer in Las Vegas.

"My husband and I, often do little staycations in Vegas. Here's a tip- Bring some bottles of booze with you so you can make your own drinks in your room before spending a fortune at the bars! We always stop by a place called Office Bar (which is a half mile from the airport on the way to the Strip) and buy a few bottles before checking into our hotel. We've stayed at all of the nice hotels on the Strip and I will soon be posting my reviews for each of them.","2013-05-26","0","t-o_Sraneime4DDhWrQRBA","vX4zE6Plk7lOlSme_U2lKw"

Offer to take orders for those dinning in! It's not too much to ask and you'd benefit from a payment at the end of the meal verses in the beginning if we chose to have dessert or an extra soda.

One of the owners or workers harassed me ON YELP. LOL. They didn't like my review I guess. Well, even more so to tell everyone I know to skip this poor sport place. Which is a shame because the drinks aren't terrible and some bartenders are really great.","2016-12-31","0","xT2uoooO9YHIR0xN9szbSw","EuWNFj1s2Z88DbZxptZF7A"
"Some of the owners or workers of Fuel Bar created a fake profile to A) write a raving review of the place and B) contact me and call me out for my poor review of the bar. One of them responded calling me a ""dumb Asian"" so since Asians are huge on Yelp, thought you ought to know. I will never go here again nor will I refer it to anyone, Asian or not.

"I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was way too spicy and the meat was not at all flavorful or contained any distinguishing spice or good taste. I had to add a ton of salt to make it taste relatively edible. The fries looked nice, but they too were bland. Shake # 4 is delicious- then the custard messes it all up. The service was polite and friendly, but it was just not worth it. May I also add that the funky ketchups are way too ambitious at being funky. It just tastes weird.","2013-06-17","0","cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g","hm4vqJi6bIF9SVnYGAOTXQ"

"I forgot to take a pic before I dug in, but if you want to have your taste buds dance while you are in Vegas, be sure to get the Porcinni rub on your steaks. Omg! The bomb!- I love this place because it's Devine and my taste buds go crazy. - I also want to mention that the flowers at the bottom of the ""French Revolution"" drink is eatable, and very tasty! Everything you will order is Devine! But the pic here is the Filet Mignon.

"The food was ok Italian food. Kinda bland.  We had three seafood 2 seafood dishes , one scampi, two with a light red sauce. The service was very good. Skip the desserts, there are some great gelato places in the area that have far better desserts than the ones we got here. We tried the chocolate eclair, the cannoli, and the strawberry topped eclair. All were slightly stale, not thick, rich and creamy like we expected. 
We will not return.","2014-09-20","0","qABb9Wzdn51VcNHdp_Qhpg","GZFMohQKG-1zVgWMZl5UBQ"

"From the minute i walked in i was greeted by Brenda at the front desk, and she was outstanding.  She was very friendly and helpful troughout my stay. She is a great asset to this property. It is people like her that better guest's first impressions when they walk in. Overall i  really enjoyed my stay here.  The room was a little outdated but very spacious and clean.  I got more than i expected from this place.  Will definitely stay here again.","2013-03-20","0","X-WXPGYuuknAjZkpYGeRiw","tdGs9ZKoYKKGSs-YEbfc7A"

"This place has the worst customer service. They don't care about the customer or loyalty at all. They just take your money and run. Do not stay here. Also don't believe what the website tells you when you book your room. It's a complete lie. They give you whatever is left over in terms of room type.","2013-01-09","0","u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ","D2xWVq38NQOJXlbhAbgLHA"
"This hotel continues on its downward spiral. It is obvious that the management team does not care and it shows. Now to add insult to injury they are now charging a ""resort fee"" of $ 20 a night. All for hotel rooms that a motel 6 could beat in cleanliness. I witnessed a room service tray sit in the hallway for over 36 hours. Stay away from here or severely lower your expectations. It is sad.

I was told the salad would feed 2, but $15 for lettuce and onions is ridiculous. The marinara wasn't good either.

NON smoking room had a strong cigarette smells and our key door was working one time ouf of 20. Beware: hotwire mention free Internet access but its 14$ to have it in the room.

"This is the worst stripe club I have ever visited. First of all, some of the females look like they are  40 y\/o and secondly, these strippers only speak to Broke ass white men and it would be nice to not see 10 fat white grills all the freaking time. And lastly, if you don't treat these strippers like they are highly educated successful and accomplished people knowing they are not These females can ask for you to be remove from the club; even if you didn't speak to that particular females.","2017-10-11","0","91QARFSeS6hkTSM91CIMOw","Ohj8YP_62HjqKEyb8O3VHw"

"Service was great but there was something that REALLY bothered me. My bf and I sat in the bar and I could see the bartender wiping his nose\/ touching cash\/wiping the counter without washing his hands before making drinks. It upset me so much because we had both ordered drinks we no longer wanted after seeing this. ALSO the waitress who was topping the cocktails wiped her hands on her pants then touched the toppings with her bare hands, gross. Not the best experience. I hope sanitation improves.","2013-07-05","0","O9LDS66IUKIBkGz_uFZKWQ","qfqnog5mzDmXTxZzaiTMTg"

"This place is a joke.The office staff is rude. A new management company took over and raised my rent $150 a month for nothing! It has taken 10 months to fix my dishwasher. Do not waste your hard earned money here. I have black mold growing on a wall in my unit. When pointed out to maintenance, I was told it was not as he wiped it off. I went to the office to advice them and was told the manager was not there. I am seeking legal council at this point. Many other tenants are too.","2014-04-17","1","EgemRE83Qe_ZbGnFcrPsng","4dQzmzjmoQO3PNdB5jS-0w"
"I have created maintenance requests. They have been closed out with out the work being done. The BLACK mold is still on my wall although I try to clean it with bleach. I have gone in the office to complain only to be told the manager is not there. In order to change my mind a lot must be done. If that is not possible reporting to the state housing authority and or legal action may be required. We were happy here until the new management took over.

"Do not rent here. The manager is rude. I just found out that he never applied my renters insurance policy to my account. He did not respond to my request to speak to him when my account was not charged correctly and now will not remove the late fees or renters insurance fee. The previous owner was pleasant. I will never rent from Life Storage again as there is ""no one else to speak to.""

And don't bother complaining about not feeling safe having mail sent to your place. Management will promptly tell you how they are new and just ""don't know"". Oh and calling Trinity is pointless, that's just leaving a voicemail for a person who will never call you back.

"I stopped in a little after 8 pm. There was a woman in the room where the piercing is done, which is seperated by a large window. A dog came out from the back and barked at me, and a little boy also came out and saw me and went back to where she was. She never once acknowledged me in any way within a 10 minute time frame even though I was standing there staring at her. HORRIBLE customer service. I finally left without any service rendered. I will never go back there.","2014-05-09","0","_Jt596tjji2NG9tKhIsW2g","p4H3qFMlqgUsp4xiXzj1Nw"

"I can't believe all the negative reviews. Folks you just paid under 70$ a night for a cool hotel on the Las Vegas strip GEEZ.  Go stay at Trump,Bellagio or Palazzo if you want turn down service or a mint on your pillow!
We had fun and a nice room. Check in took 15 minutes. Come early not at 3pm like everyone else

"I bought a new E250 today from Sebastian and the manager, Steve Kaplan.  The price was $400 less than I suggested I pay, but that wasn't the best part.  The staff were super, handling a difficult registration process in another state.  They also filled the tank, only $80. But that never happened to me before. Y only regret?  I didn't need 2 cars, wish I did the price and service was so great.

"Hmm a lot of the reviews sound alike? Just an observation. Crew is said a lot lol. Don't buy the koolaid! It's way over priced. It is a nice product however I would talk to all customers and references to see if pricing is the same. When a professional estimator comes and they are commissioned then you may want to check to see if your not being quoted to much. They never followed up when I simply asked them to remove the ""high cost"" area's. Never got it? Why.

"Just redecorated by someone with less taste than before. It was a modern design. Now they are appealing to older new yorkers. Subway tile behind the prep counter. Brown square tile looks like residential homedepot tile. Old lights like 1945. They lost some seating to a huge new refrigerator. Got rid of a nice sseating bench and sepeerate tables on the west walls and replaced it with a big community table. Fire those responcable. But I doubt if anyone will stop going there regardless.","2014-02-23","0","zUbqJk1KtbMnStiMfrMegA","x0cbvislTvwFrzbYMXM3Gw"

"I come here pretty often but I was disappointed with my service last night.

First, the guy didn't know to make the smoothie I wanted (totally green). Second, he didn't know the wifi password. Third, he skipped my order and attended to 4 other customers that came and called in their orders AFTER me. 

Took them over 20 mins to make my smoothie! My sister was halfway done with hers by the time I got mine.

"This Olive Garden had some of weirdest customer service I've seen. Our waiter came to our table in a bad mood and a negative attitude. He wasn't very focused on doing his job it seemed like he had somewhere better to be. And when we tried to talk to management they kept avoiding our table. I visited this Olive Garden on my anniversary and expected a nice dinner and that didn't happen. Sad to say I will never come to this location again.","2014-02-06","0","viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw","hzlR-FYQ7QpewSx1Y8uCHQ"

"Offensive. The rude, pretentious hostess greeted us with suspicion. It took her a few moments to speak and rather than a smiling welcome she tersely asked if we had a reservation. We did not. With her mouth agape in disgust she had to see someone else. Every table was empty. She returned and said, ""They need some time."" A Japanese group walked in and was immediately greeted enthusiastically by the hostess and some of the chefs. We were never greeted at all and decided to leave.","2013-07-06","0","82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw","tdygTnmH033ny65XOsRudQ"

The menu is slightly small, hardly a variety of items but it still looks tasty. I ordered the Thai Beef Salad and the first bite was an explosion of flavor...salt being a heavily one. It's not so bad here, but I'm just not sure if the prices are worth coming back. Happy Hour is another story....","2014-03-30","0","5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg","Yi8blDfoSpyAg1lvLBFJpA"

But I have tried every one of them. They are all good. We ordered a spicy and a non spicy roll at a time. So good. Haven't tried appetizers at all since the rolls are so yum.

"If you're bringing kids and getting the ayce, double check your receipt because they charge slightly more than half the adult price even though the menu says half price.

Also don't get the yakitori.  If you've had real yakitori you will be very disappointed.  This is basically cooked (not grilled) meat put onto a stick (more like a bad kabob) and takes a long time for them to make.","2017-07-02","0","ugLqbAvBdRDc-gS4hpslXw","EO9IhCrf4SiQ7iCQwUb6CQ"

"Just left there and right from the minute we walked in the place sucked. The hostess never turned around to greet us finally we sat ourselves at the sushi bar. Not one chef looked up and said hello. They didn't give us everything we ordered and when we complained they blamed it on the non speaking Mexican chef.agter 10 minutes of getting a dish we finished I asked a different chef what happened to our chef they said he went on break no one else asked us if we wanted more.

The deserts looked amazing but we were far too full to try. The biscuits beat corn bread any day!

"Dr. Eric Miller. Ah. What a waste. He dismisses everything you say and ask then leaves you hanging with no script refills then leaves SW medical so I had to go in to see another new doctor who was 100x better than him.

"This is an awesome place to get drinks, karaoke, and food all at once. Not only was the food awesome, but i was impressed with the options on the menu. Above all, the server\/bartender, Angela was on top of her game. I never had an empty glass nor trash or dirty plates sitting around me. Her table maintenance was on point, and I loved how she engaged with her guests, & sang karaoke as well. Made my 1st time experience wanting to come back and tell others about this place.","2016-11-02","0","X0qAF43gdcd5Deah3drNuQ","puJQiSa5y9QXSeV7PYC11w"

"Dirty little weasels charged me a Groupon tax of $2.00 to use my Groupon. What a sneaky little trick to get back money on their promotion. Lost my respect. 
Food was good, waiter was nice. But charging me $2 to use my groupon is a dirty move.

So my $12 for $20 of food became $14 for $20. 
They don't even let you know. They just sneak it in on the bill. 

Although I liked the restaurant food, I felt tak3n advantage of and disrespected.","2017-07-24","0","8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ","YgHUW35j48l4QRYyMH5mCw"

They always have the most interesting seasonal produce.  Their lettuce is the best I have ever had.  The people who work that stand will help you with suggested uses for produce you're unfamiliar with.  Chef Stewart will share his amazing recipes.  My favorite: fresh English pea risotto. :) to die for.","2014-02-11","0","alaiXlogA286nuM8tj9ghw","aDlBarTjGmHCEOdwATdCnw"

"I gave this place a wonderful review about a year ago. Lately, they've hired a new cashier to work the busiest times, on Friday through Sunday. This person has repeatedly messed up money. First I got overcharged on my card & my server had to apologize & reimburse me. Then I was given someone else's credit card & who knows where mine went? Today I had to ask for change from my server. I finally get my change from the cashier with an attitude for dessert. After over 20 minutes.","2017-11-24","0","0G1y7uV7w1D2uziS4Lt_Dw","1LAaJpirIAhlOMIuQSbHiw"

"Turmeric has a peppery, warm and bitter flavor and a mild fragrance slightly reminiscent of orange and ginger, and it is best known as one of the ingredients used to make curry. Turmeric has long been used as a powerful anti-inflammatory in both the Chinese and Indian systems of medicine. Turmeric was traditionally called ""Indian saffron"" because of its deep yellow-orange color and has been used throughout history as a condiment, healing remedy and textile dye.","2014-01-09","0","4-clU4CDRc3c30zrCSV2_Q","34dg-NFUtfUxP3F4nARNAQ"
"Spinach contains nutritional and medicinal properties to strengthen our immune system, boost energy levels, provide our bodies vitamins and minerals.The A and C vitamins in spinach plus the fiber, folate, magnesium and other nutrients show promise against certain cancers, especially colon, lung and breast cancers.

"Karen did good work, however, when it came time to pay she wanted to charge me $5 more for buffing my fingernails. Say what?!? I've never been charged extra for a buff in place of a polish after a manicure. That ""extra service"" isn't even on their menu. She tried to tell me it hadn't been updated. I said she should have told me before performing the service. She took it off the bill (after I told her I would pay for it).

As for the food, I wasn't very impressed; too expensive for what you get. The meats [steak, chicken & lobster] were all overcooked. The highlight of the meal was the salsa served with chips & the hand-made tortillas. I would be inclined to visit again if their prices were a little lower.","2013-05-25","0","Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg","nReXS3VKb0aZPY4klM37VQ"

"Whent to this restaurant on a Saturday night.  The place was good, had nice atmosphere. The waiter was nice and on top of our refills. The down side was that our waiter forgot to place our order to the cook so it took about 20min to get our food.  Then when we got our food he brought me the wrong plate.  At this point I did not want to wait another 10-20 min for a new plate.","2013-07-07","0","Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg","uZbCCaO43ayq705KoA_EKg"

"First time trying their pizza last weekend. I just got a medium pepperoni. Delivery arrived 30 min later. Okay, being a Boston pizza fan, I'll really give my honest opinion. First dough: excellent. Nice taste, soft and fluffy... just the way I like it. Pizza sauce: below average... either it's already made or their pizza sauce is really bland. Cheese: for some reason really heavy. I give a 5 outta 10 overall on their pizza","2015-07-28","0","VzekjBEdqFdJsXEOWInA1A","FvFGoFrfVuaw-ZLI39uccA"

In the past few visits, we have become extremely dissatisfied. The quality of fish has gone done incredibly.

The restroom is by far one of the worst in terms of cleanliness . The drive-thru has been extremely slow every time I've ordered, with food missing.

"Bring a hammer, nails, and a black out curtain for every room.  They have horrible 1810 style blinds with no shade covering them and a bright light shining outside every window (for security I was told) so you cannot sleep without light in the room.  Just when the lights shut off, the sun rises and the room is filled with light.  In a town where you need to sleep late, this is a horrible design.

However, the pork belly in the pork belly buns were tragically overcooked. To the point that I had trouble cutting it with a knife. The very polite waitress offered to get the manager, who never showed up. We asked again and they took it off the bill. Oxtail chili cheese fries were good.

"(This place is so close to back east pizza.)

 I almost feel like I'm back when I take that first bite of a slice. The pizza is as close as I've had in Vegas to long island pizza. The chicken parm is pretty darn good too. I love it really. They are all very nice employees as well. Place is always clean. I wish I would've started going there sooner. 
Oh yeah I swear that in the dinners it was mozzarella on the french fries...","2013-05-26","0","r6jbUGiyoN05mZ13apQGgw","STxrjmkP7PtwvMUrb3Y7VA"

Who quoted me $20 dollars more than their other location. When I asked them if all Ted Wiens locations were same price he said yes and he could not honor their misquote.

Only went because my friend is on vaca broke a nail and needed a quick fill so i called the guy told me one price but when she was done it was twice the price. And i decided to get a mani cause well who doesnt like a manicure any who the guy who did my nails did a sloppy job i literally could have done a better job myself.
