"Yesterday I was dinning here and all of a sudden I witnessed Anna reprimanding her employee in front of not only the guests but the employees as well. I'm a member of management myself and when I have a problem with an employee I pull them to the side away from everything and everyone. I'm just saying that this action was very unprofessional and im sure that the employee that was being reprimanded was very embarrassed.

We walk in with 17 people and the best they could offer us was the patio. That would have been fine but it was chilly and we asked if there were heaters and the manager stated NO. So we left.

Ordered up Las Vegas chili dog, with white sage chili, an order of buffalo cheese fries and draft root beer (no frosted glass..bummer). Yeah this will do just fine while I am here in Vegas. Pastrami was tasty, but they cook it on the grill and it dries out a bit. Cali still has the best west coast pastrami hands down on this coast.

"Do NOT believe the ""waiting time"" posted on their website or anywhere else that quotes ER waiting times....I saw a wait time of 17 minutes so I went to the ER....8.5 hours later I was seen....only after checking with the triage nurse to tell them how long I had been waiting and a nurse standing behind her that took pity on me and took me back to be seen...if you walk in and the waiting room is packed as it was that morning,I suggest you find another ER...that is my tip.","2014-04-04","0","8qnPy-4QV1VGkoeu2LGa9g","3aoRGjx2Wl0y5U9cVi4msA"

"Always wanting to support the small business rather than the chains we went here again and as usual had a great time. I ordered the veal Parma and it was worth it. Friends ordered the eggplant Parma and other stuff which I did not think was as great but each to their own. We got the complimentary wine immediately and the garlic bread and all he other stuff as it advertises. The according player played us any Sinatra\/Martin sing we could throw at him, got us in the mood!","2015-07-22","0","yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w","jkYdTExuqC_ZjtnJRQNYFQ"

"Walked back in time when we entered this place. Obviously it was the go-to place back in its heyday. Nostalgia galore with prominent and proud photos of many of the stars through the years. 

I'm not sure you're really coming here for the food but it's all in all decent and not too hard on the pocketbook for a night out in Vegas. 

We had Chicken Rio, lasagna and cannelloni. No one could finish our meals. The table wine that comes with your meal isn't 90point wine but decent enough with dinner.","2017-08-29","0","yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w","c-zf2KZB8xYWugFXx3ZBpg"

Then ask why his business post on the website what a Class A facility is when they clearly are nowhere near a Class A facility. This guy is the biggest clown in town. Biggest scammer in Las Vegas.

"My husband and I, often do little staycations in Vegas. Here's a tip- Bring some bottles of booze with you so you can make your own drinks in your room before spending a fortune at the bars! We always stop by a place called Office Bar (which is a half mile from the airport on the way to the Strip) and buy a few bottles before checking into our hotel. We've stayed at all of the nice hotels on the Strip and I will soon be posting my reviews for each of them.","2013-05-26","0","t-o_Sraneime4DDhWrQRBA","vX4zE6Plk7lOlSme_U2lKw"

We went for breakfast and spend almost an hour with all the waiting. The food and coffee were actually good, even tough nobody of the staff seems to like their jobs. 

We sat close to the front desk and the phones keeps ringing while nobody picking it up. Kind of annoying after a while.

Offer to take orders for those dinning in! It's not too much to ask and you'd benefit from a payment at the end of the meal verses in the beginning if we chose to have dessert or an extra soda.

"I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was way too spicy and the meat was not at all flavorful or contained any distinguishing spice or good taste. I had to add a ton of salt to make it taste relatively edible. The fries looked nice, but they too were bland. Shake # 4 is delicious- then the custard messes it all up. The service was polite and friendly, but it was just not worth it. May I also add that the funky ketchups are way too ambitious at being funky. It just tastes weird.","2013-06-17","0","cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g","hm4vqJi6bIF9SVnYGAOTXQ"

I would definitely recommend presenting the seven stars card to bypass the super long line (especially during the holidays). If not, it's still worth the wait the wait in my opinion.

"The food was ok Italian food. Kinda bland.  We had three seafood 2 seafood dishes , one scampi, two with a light red sauce. The service was very good. Skip the desserts, there are some great gelato places in the area that have far better desserts than the ones we got here.

I was told the salad would feed 2, but $15 for lettuce and onions is ridiculous. The marinara wasn't good either. Just so you know, they don't make orders for one so there's lots leftover, and I don't really want to eat it and I love Italian food!

"Very disappointing. Many hotel in Vegas, avoid this one. Hidden additional fees, very noisy AC in the room. We payed extra fees to get around the pool and for a balcony which we didn't had. NON smoking room had a strong cigarette smells and our key door was working one time ouf of 20. Beware: hotwire mention free Internet access but its 14$ to have it in the room. Its only free at the bar. For all our problems, the staff told us, there is nothing we can do to help , it's a not our fault.","2013-06-08","0","owLXnEhlMLsFpemYoOxNkg","JbyMc9-80NeTRcg_c4cdHg"

"Just as others mentioned: cheap construction, thin walls and floors equal a noisy hotel where you can hear every footstep above and every door slam. 
We stayed in C102 closest to the exit leading to the casino. There's a massive electric pump motor winding up, then grinding to a halt with a thud all night. Seriously, it sounds like a truck backing into the building every few minutes.

First of all, some of the females look like they are  40 y\/o and secondly, these strippers only speak to Broke ass white men and it would be nice to not see 10 fat white grills all the freaking time. And lastly, if you don't treat these strippers like they are highly educated successful and accomplished people knowing they are not These females can ask for you to be remove from the club; even if you didn't speak to that particular females.","2017-10-11","0","91QARFSeS6hkTSM91CIMOw","Ohj8YP_62HjqKEyb8O3VHw"

"Wow peeps.. This place is a meat lovers destination. I left my green place card up (cause that's how I roll) for a good 20-25 minutes and the meat kept rolling out. I was impressed with the speedy service and seasoning of the different cuts of meat. The sauce on the table (chili and some type of parsley) was tasty. Daddy likes!!!!

"Service was great but there was something that REALLY bothered me. My bf and I sat in the bar and I could see the bartender wiping his nose\/ touching cash\/wiping the counter without washing his hands before making drinks. It upset me so much because we had both ordered drinks we no longer wanted after seeing this. ALSO the waitress who was topping the cocktails wiped her hands on her pants then touched the toppings with her bare hands, gross. Not the best experience. I hope sanitation improves.","2013-07-05","0","O9LDS66IUKIBkGz_uFZKWQ","qfqnog5mzDmXTxZzaiTMTg"

"This place is a joke.The office staff is rude. A new management company took over and raised my rent $150 a month for nothing! It has taken 10 months to fix my dishwasher. Do not waste your hard earned money here. I have black mold growing on a wall in my unit. When pointed out to maintenance, I was told it was not as he wiped it off. I went to the office to advice them and was told the manager was not there. I am seeking legal council at this point.

"I have created maintenance requests. They have been closed out with out the work being done. The BLACK mold is still on my wall although I try to clean it with bleach. I have gone in the office to complain only to be told the manager is not there. In order to change my mind a lot must be done. If that is not possible reporting to the state housing authority and or legal action may be required. We were happy here until the new management took over. I'm not sure why or how they still have a job.","2014-05-31","0","EgemRE83Qe_ZbGnFcrPsng","4dQzmzjmoQO3PNdB5jS-0w"

"Do not rent here. The manager is rude. I just found out that he never applied my renters insurance policy to my account. He did not respond to my request to speak to him when my account was not charged correctly and now will not remove the late fees or renters insurance fee. The previous owner was pleasant. I will never rent from Life Storage again as there is ""no one else to speak to."" I find it hard to believe there is no leadership above this man.","2015-11-06","0","mxXt56_UdRQCHB1kftx5lw","4dQzmzjmoQO3PNdB5jS-0w"

And don't bother complaining about not feeling safe having mail sent to your place. Management will promptly tell you how they are new and just ""don't know"". Oh and calling Trinity is pointless, that's just leaving a voicemail for a person who will never call you back.

"Super awesome!!! 5 star food and 5 star friendly service.  Baked ziti with Italian sausage to die for.  Definitely two meals, baked in a garlic crust. Heavenly.   Black and white sliders delicious.   Angus beef, blue cheese, carmilized onion.  You have to have the ranch chips......yummmy...home made food at very affordable prices.   The lemoncello is secret Italian recipe.   Do eat and drink here.   Will be back....","2013-11-24","0","XeDLyY2a7nZ3IEY4RYslXA","vaONVd09sp0Locps-Vrjmg"

"The food was good but the service was amazing. The chips are a little hard, the guacamole was a little bland, and the alpastor has a hint of curry or another spice that gave it a weird flavor. However the carne asada gran taco is to die for.

"I stopped in a little after 8 pm. There was a woman in the room where the piercing is done, which is seperated by a large window. A dog came out from the back and barked at me, and a little boy also came out and saw me and went back to where she was. She never once acknowledged me in any way within a 10 minute time frame even though I was standing there staring at her. HORRIBLE customer service. I finally left without any service rendered. I will never go back there.","2014-05-09","0","_Jt596tjji2NG9tKhIsW2g","p4H3qFMlqgUsp4xiXzj1Nw"

"I can't believe all the negative reviews. Folks you just paid under 70$ a night for a cool hotel on the Las Vegas strip GEEZ.  Go stay at Trump,Bellagio or Palazzo if you want turn down service or a mint on your pillow!
We had fun and a nice room. Check in took 15 minutes. Come early not at 3pm like everyone else

"I bought a new E250 today from Sebastian and the manager, Steve Kaplan.  The price was $400 less than I suggested I pay, but that wasn't the best part.  The staff were super, handling a difficult registration process in another state.  They also filled the tank, only $80. But that never happened to me before. Y only regret?  I didn't need 2 cars, wish I did the price and service was so great.

"Just redecorated by someone with less taste than before. It was a modern design. Now they are appealing to older new yorkers. Subway tile behind the prep counter. Brown square tile looks like residential homedepot tile. Old lights like 1945. They lost some seating to a huge new refrigerator. Got rid of a nice sseating bench and sepeerate tables on the west walls and replaced it with a big community table. Fire those responcable. But I doubt if anyone will stop going there regardless.","2014-02-23","0","zUbqJk1KtbMnStiMfrMegA","x0cbvislTvwFrzbYMXM3Gw"

"This was the worst sushi place I have eaten.. We ordered an appetizer first and didn't get it until right before our last roll.. The sushi tasted old and they didn't have a great selection of rolls. They seemed to sprinkle it with something that didn't taste good, almost like they've never tasted it before...

"I come here pretty often but I was disappointed with my service last night.

First, the guy didn't know to make the smoothie I wanted (totally green). Second, he didn't know the wifi password. Third, he skipped my order and attended to 4 other customers that came and called in their orders AFTER me. 

Took them over 20 mins to make my smoothie! My sister was halfway done with hers by the time I got mine.

He wasn't very focused on doing his job it seemed like he had somewhere better to be. And when we tried to talk to management they kept avoiding our table. I visited this Olive Garden on my anniversary and expected a nice dinner and that didn't happen. Sad to say I will never come to this location again.","2014-02-06","0","viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw","hzlR-FYQ7QpewSx1Y8uCHQ"

"Offensive. The rude, pretentious hostess greeted us with suspicion. It took her a few moments to speak and rather than a smiling welcome she tersely asked if we had a reservation. We did not. With her mouth agape in disgust she had to see someone else. Every table was empty. She returned and said, ""They need some time."" A Japanese group walked in and was immediately greeted enthusiastically by the hostess and some of the chefs.

The menu is slightly small, hardly a variety of items but it still looks tasty. I ordered the Thai Beef Salad and the first bite was an explosion of flavor...salt being a heavily one. It's not so bad here, but I'm just not sure if the prices are worth coming back. Happy Hour is another story....","2014-03-30","0","5CJL_2-XwCGBmOav4mFdYg","Yi8blDfoSpyAg1lvLBFJpA"

But I have tried every one of them. They are all good. We ordered a spicy and a non spicy roll at a time. So good. Haven't tried appetizers at all since the rolls are so yum.

"If you're bringing kids and getting the ayce, double check your receipt because they charge slightly more than half the adult price even though the menu says half price.

Also don't get the yakitori.  If you've had real yakitori you will be very disappointed.  This is basically cooked (not grilled) meat put onto a stick (more like a bad kabob) and takes a long time for them to make.","2017-07-02","0","ugLqbAvBdRDc-gS4hpslXw","EO9IhCrf4SiQ7iCQwUb6CQ"

"Just left there and right from the minute we walked in the place sucked. The hostess never turned around to greet us finally we sat ourselves at the sushi bar. Not one chef looked up and said hello. They didn't give us everything we ordered and when we complained they blamed it on the non speaking Mexican chef.agter 10 minutes of getting a dish we finished I asked a different chef what happened to our chef they said he went on break no one else asked us if we wanted more.

My Girlfriend had Yellow Chicken Curry Spicy 3 and Thai Tea. The Curry was perfect too! It wasn't too spicy, and the chicken wasn't dry. The Thai Tea wasn't bad either.

"I've been going to Tease ever since Heidi Dominguez, my manicurist of 7 years, moved there. The salon is rather upscale and nice. But more importantly, if you're looking for a great person to do your nails, go see Heidi. She makes great recommendations, has tons of colors and is very flexible. She's meticulous about cleaning instruments and the gals at Tease always do a thorough job of cleaning out the pedicure basin.

"Dirty little weasels charged me a Groupon tax of $2.00 to use my Groupon. What a sneaky little trick to get back money on their promotion. Lost my respect. 
Food was good, waiter was nice. But charging me $2 to use my groupon is a dirty move.

So my $12 for $20 of food became $14 for $20. 
They don't even let you know. They just sneak it in on the bill. 

Although I liked the restaurant food, I felt tak3n advantage of and disrespected.","2017-07-24","0","8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ","YgHUW35j48l4QRYyMH5mCw"

"Be sure you look at which is a premium entrée and which is not. Most people get upset when they find that one of the entrées is $1.25 extra and want to complain to the cashier that it's too pricey. Please look at the top where it says the name. Yes, it's cool to point at what you want and all, but be aware that if you are going to complain and hold up the line for failing to pay attention to detail then it is your mistake.","2016-02-08","0","JsGswUxAFK4uRht2UL62UA","pYx_n7jkmRuq0cjm0lqftw"

They always have the most interesting seasonal produce.  Their lettuce is the best I have ever had.  The people who work that stand will help you with suggested uses for produce you're unfamiliar with.  Chef Stewart will share his amazing recipes.

"Today was a one star visit I use the Groupon so I got great value but I watched them make the food with no gloves on hands and as a guy cooked the vegetables, I noticed he had a bad infection on his elbows and again no gloves on and I asked the waitress and pointed it out to her and she said was just dirt.

And when I tried going into the restaurant he yelled at me for wanting to go in.

First I got overcharged on my card & my server had to apologize & reimburse me. Then I was given someone else's credit card & who knows where mine went? Today I had to ask for change from my server. I finally get my change from the cashier with an attitude for dessert. After over 20 minutes.","2017-11-24","0","0G1y7uV7w1D2uziS4Lt_Dw","1LAaJpirIAhlOMIuQSbHiw"

"Called there to set up a appt to tint my car, the price they quoted on the phone was different then what they tell you when you get there, classic bait and switch. 154.95 turned into over 220.00. Save your time as they will waste it by making you an appt, get your glass tinted at trop and Maryland a lil place behind the self service car wash, $140 out the door no BS no bait and switch.","2013-08-07","0","5yLJRH-mcARO2AfiWKvwkA","Qn_M0DGu6DJoSiPDCN2vMw"

Turmeric has long been used as a powerful anti-inflammatory in both the Chinese and Indian systems of medicine.

As for the food, I wasn't very impressed; too expensive for what you get. The meats [steak, chicken & lobster] were all overcooked. The highlight of the meal was the salsa served with chips & the hand-made tortillas. I would be inclined to visit again if their prices were a little lower.","2013-05-25","0","Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg","nReXS3VKb0aZPY4klM37VQ"

"Whent to this restaurant on a Saturday night.  The place was good, had nice atmosphere. The waiter was nice and on top of our refills. The down side was that our waiter forgot to place our order to the cook so it took about 20min to get our food.  Then when we got our food he brought me the wrong plate.  At this point I did not want to wait another 10-20 min for a new plate.","2013-07-07","0","Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg","uZbCCaO43ayq705KoA_EKg"

"While it was very good. I don't quite agree with some of the others that say it's the best ever.  The food was very flavorful  but the presentation left a lot to be desired. I would rate it as a good place to have very Mexico City style Mexican food. But if your looking for exceptional I would have to say pass","2014-05-03","0","iIFMeiovZ2o7RzJ_1YYVww","p6dzzYSa_c64PtkZd_wGWA"

"First time trying their pizza last weekend. I just got a medium pepperoni. Delivery arrived 30 min later. Okay, being a Boston pizza fan, I'll really give my honest opinion. First dough: excellent. Nice taste, soft and fluffy... just the way I like it. Pizza sauce: below average... either it's already made or their pizza sauce is really bland. Cheese: for some reason really heavy. I give a 5 outta 10 overall on their pizza","2015-07-28","0","VzekjBEdqFdJsXEOWInA1A","FvFGoFrfVuaw-ZLI39uccA"

In the past few visits, we have become extremely dissatisfied. The quality of fish has gone done incredibly. We were just there for all u can eat the other night and were upset by the warm\/chewy fish that was presented. We know good sushi, and this wasnt it. It put a bad taste in our mouths, and I don't think we'll be going back.","2013-03-11","0","GY5v_jZFuFGRyqqY4xEN7g","GLj5OJM8O_2k-1SNFnPS9A"

"I've come to this location multiple on  occasions on each occasion the service has been extremely slow. The restaurant is never clean. The restroom is by far one of the worst in terms of cleanliness . The drive-thru has been extremely slow every time I've ordered, with food missing.  I mostly believe this is so because the women stand around mocking & gossiping about the customers in Spanish rather than assisting the customers, providing accuracy on their orders or cleaning.","2017-11-14","0","EVYGEs6vJwUPvapGPrKvfA","8x4upDPyYKC7EPDAaZPRlg"

"Bring a hammer, nails, and a black out curtain for every room.  They have horrible 1810 style blinds with no shade covering them and a bright light shining outside every window (for security I was told) so you cannot sleep without light in the room.  Just when the lights shut off, the sun rises and the room is filled with light.  In a town where you need to sleep late, this is a horrible design.  I am here now and completely angry and exhausted and will be calling for a refund.","2015-10-23","0","-0qht1roIqleKiQkBLDkbw","-uwwb_vPz_XpcteZUsN0bg"

However, the pork belly in the pork belly buns were tragically overcooked. To the point that I had trouble cutting it with a knife. The very polite waitress offered to get the manager, who never showed up. We asked again and they took it off the bill. Oxtail chili cheese fries were good.

Ate some chili, drank some beers, and left happy. I was getting tore up. but the bartenders kept chatting with us, laughed, joked, ate, played, relaxed. Had my chilli and beer taken care of. Tipped them what I would of paid anyways just because they took care of me and made my visit great.","2015-11-10","0","Kb_FHcPVmZpF4FlKla3TPQ","iUdH5Sats3cF46CePD6CYw"

"(This place is so close to back east pizza.)

 I almost feel like I'm back when I take that first bite of a slice. The pizza is as close as I've had in Vegas to long island pizza. The chicken parm is pretty darn good too. I love it really. They are all very nice employees as well. Place is always clean. I wish I would've started going there sooner. 
Oh yeah I swear that in the dinners it was mozzarella on the french fries...","2013-05-26","0","r6jbUGiyoN05mZ13apQGgw","STxrjmkP7PtwvMUrb3Y7VA"

Who quoted me $20 dollars more than their other location. When I asked them if all Ted Wiens locations were same price he said yes and he could not honor their misquote.

"I like that's it's simple and clean. All the girls give you the attention you need! As soon as you walk in the door, you are greeted and advised to pick a color. The wait is not long at all if you just walk in. They are quick but they do a great job! I came here before I got married then started going somewhere else closer to my house but man- I WAS CRAZY! I am glad I started coming back here. :)","2014-07-23","0","0T9Bp_vXjCnPria4SWv8mA","ADZbVX8qeN9oFV2U-2NbOw"
