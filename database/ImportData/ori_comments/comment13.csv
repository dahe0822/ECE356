"Salt and pepper pork chops are succulent, but a little bony. Also, I recommend trying the honey walnut fried shrimp. It is a little on the sweet side, but is actually some of the best I've had when it's fresh. Pending on who's at the register, they'll offer you free egg rolls, which are mediocre. Lastly, my personal fave dish is kung pao. I always use kung pao as a scale on how I'll like other dishes because of its simplicity.

We asked for toasted bread a couple times. The second time we asked, the server said, ""it wasn't warm enough for you?"" and then brought out burnt bread. We asked for hot sauce three times and still no sign of it. Maybe we'll get it for dessert.

"The ricotta meatballs are delicious but extremely spicy.  Do NOT order the Mac and cheese with truffle sauce it's chalky and truffle sauce has no truffle flavor. The flatbread fondue (pictured) is tasteless and bland, not to mention a small strip of prosciutto was the only thing that gave the dish flavor. Also it was super chalky and not creamy as a fondue should be. I would skip on the appetizer selection altogether.  Unless you are ordering the meatballs.","2014-03-14","0","wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q","JM8Uao_GOpr7alfBZm5OBQ"

"Horribly rude. I called at 9:15 and asked if they would be open until ten and they said yes. I drove clear across town to get there and arrived at 9:52 . They already had the sign off and were inside cleaning up. I knocked and they ignored me. I tried to yell through the door that I was the one that called and the girl and asian guy working there basically just laughed. So unprofessional and inconsiderate they don't deserve jobs there.","2017-05-30","0","fgrMJzwI-AcdvhNZgFCgvw","zEFb-H927feMJQVtbrqnZg"

"Tailgating here is awesome.  Even the dirt field on the south side is worth the $15 cash. The environment is friendly and the sharks and scalpers are minimal. The only major issue is the that they have no Porta john's on this side of the stadium so you have to walk all the way around to use the restroom.","2013-12-21","0","4v4-h0rAl5XZY1NCpHU30g","FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ"

She was complaining that they don't get pay enough and they don't get a lot of hours . Now you know why they have horrible customer service !

"Congratulations! If you can do more than one lap around this park without being bored to death, your stronger than me.     To the tip. Come here early. Why? 1st to stake your spot on the infield. This is a MUST to avoid people doing cross fit, rapid fit, life fit, core fit, yoga fit, coco fit, fit camp, boot camp, fat camp, and guys with ""Tapout"" shorts practicing their moves for the octagon. 2nd to see the pattern of the sprinklers so you don't get a face and mouth full of ""gray water"".

Things to like great bathrooms,  many shade areas, benches for oldies to rest on the walk\/run path, water with wild life. The list goes on and on.  I have one negative. It's not close to home like the wetlands. But I have to give it to Hendo for some of the best parks now. Will the County regain the title?","2013-06-01","0","BmIJ_sPpIpIKsP3vubus8g","deY-YVlabd-SgHJpYKdzVA"

My date had a $6 Crocodile Cooler reminiscent of the rum and fruit juice drinks of Frankie's tiki room. I had a $4.50 Jim Bean mint julep.

I sampled the $4.99 Orleans Gumbo as I make a stellar gumbo and wanted to compare Lucile's to my own. The Orleans Gumbo was a better than average but not amazing.

"I've worked with trainers my whole adult life and Chuck is the BEST!!! He specifically addresses all of my goals and needs. I thought getting in shape would be a super hard and long process, but within a few weeks I saw results in my body that I didn't even think we're freaking possible. He always listens to my concerns, and answers my questions in a knowledgeable, professional way. I can't reccomend him enough, but the proof is in the way I look. Give him a few months, you'll NEVER look back!","2016-04-08","0","czjsNPyOafGDmzOao4wtiw","4mSa3n4pNMfHHGc2h0HzcA"

"Still one of the best gyms to work out in if looking for a basic routine. Lift small but RWC makes up for it by having various types of exercise outlets available - swimming,basketball,dance room,etc. Wish they had a steam room,though.

"PROS: 
-the square footage is pretty expansive
- the stage: it's awesome,lets leave it at that. 
- the talent: they have some pretty cool live DJs,from Bauuer to Axwell which are sure to attract many

CONS:
- only one bar. Really?
- pool itself is smaller than most party pools,almost rivaling Tao Beach's
- the door: LightGroup has a reputation for mishandling their lines and Daylight is no exception. Come early.

Conclusion: unless you're coming to see a particular DJ,go to Wet Republic or EBC.","2013-05-29","0","mu9SOad1xQHC0te41ec0MQ","uCK07bLSTIWP4K88VvGW_g"

"you have to try their target brand (market pantry) soft french baguettes! We only use this type of bread for bruschetta, Caprese sandwiches, or toast points for a pâté, cheese and fruit night! It's perfect after you toast them up at home. We're addicted! We grab a 3 baguettes at a time and freeze them if we don't use them in time.
