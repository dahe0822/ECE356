Too bad Chicago is NOTHING like NY :) but as pizza goes, this place blows Rosati's away, if you like Chicago pizza. The thin crust is great & the cheese is good, pepperoni, meh. (I like fresh sliced margerhita ) & sauce, in true Chicago fashion, is too sweet for me, but, overall, this is a decent pie !","2013-04-08","0","dGuVYsA5DMCm_TjSbX6x7g","RgcELxWLcm7WPmuz7suNXQ"

Being inside during the summer should be a reprieve. Greens is NOT a place to be if you want to avoid the summer heat.","2014-07-05","0","p5rpYtxS5xPQjt3MXYVEwA","b355O8OuNhTTm65__Um40Q"

Went to speak with doctor to get a second opinion. He came back in the room and said the Doctor saw the same thing. A week after I went to a cardiologist He ran a stress test.

"I went to get my hair cut at the salon. I advised the hairstylist the cut I was interested in. Not sure why but when cutting my hair she made me stand up. I asked her if I could sit on the seat. Every thing else was fine until I washed my hair to realized one side of my hair is longer than the other and she missed a few strands of hair. Very disappointing mostly because true total cost for my haircut was much more than previous quoted.

"My mom got her hair done there and when she told the hair stylist Mary that she didn't like it she got all offended and stated that she wouldn't fix it. Not that she couldn't but that she wouldn't. Mary stated it looked great the way it was done. And that she liked it. Not being concerned with how the customer feel about it.  She was very rude, and although refunded the money for the hairstyle she was unwilling to fix her mistake.

"I have been to every ""top tier"" doughnut place in the Las Vegas valley, and I can assure you this is the best doughnut shop in town. I have never even seen a blueberry fritter anywhere else, their caramel covered cinnamon roll is to die for when they warm it up for you, and they are one of only two places that even have white cream filling available as an option. I don't care for that Bavarian cream or Boston cream. I will drive 12 miles one way for this place.","2014-05-31","0","hZAxcfDnLOkFY6G5ofI2RQ","5G-Qua-1NywCbHWskRtiUw"

"I have given them two chances to make a good tasting cake. But their cakes, both icing and the actual cake itself, just lack sweetness and flavor. All of my guests agreed at the last gathering, that cake was the worst we've ever had. We threw most of it away. When you have to throw away cake with kids around, something is wrong.   Both times I have purchased their cakes, they've been like this. I thought the first time was a fluke, but no. I must find a new custom cake shop now. :(","2017-07-07","0","olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg","5G-Qua-1NywCbHWskRtiUw"

"The ordering process is ridiculous because you can't see a menu (they don't have a big one on the wall) until you get right up to the register to order.

"They have been closed for some time now due to a kitchen fire. They were originally supposed to reopen on May 1st, but keep pushing the date back.

"They changed the ""parking area"" and moved it just over a half mile back from where you used to be able to park, which is totally unnecessary of course, so just be forewarned.

HOWEVER, the cheese on the nachos was just enough to cover 4 chips. WTF!!!! and I had to take my 3 tacos and use the meat and cheese and lettuce to make one taco.  Obviously the is an issue with portion control.  I have eaten at taco bell for 20 + years.  Its was really disappointing. ... the worst.

"They increased the price of the toenail polish change to $15, which I think is way too high for that service (it was $10). Additionally, they didn't tell me of the increase until AFTER they'd already ran my card and I questioned the price.

"Always busy. Find a tech you like and make an appointment with them but even with an appointment, be wary of the term ""10 minutes"" its code for ""30+minutes"" I wish they were better at managing the techs schedules. I would rather you tell me honestly how long it will be or if someone is behind. More people are willing to understand that. Because saying 10 minutes and waiting 30 in extremely AGGRAVATING. Even if you have them, expect to wait, a long time....appointments are pretty much pointless.","2015-08-17","0","0pvEQRFVBjxz1W7dNpNZFg","E9IlgNIKYTcu3E3kXz3rXw"

"I love the clothes here. You can buy anything for anyone of all ages. They have styles for all ages: women, teens\/juniors for boys and girls, a small section for kids, men, there's also a section for people who wear plus sizes. The clothes they have are very good quality brands for up to 60% off! From formal to casual to work attire to swimwear and more, I think they have it all! The staff are really friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend anyone to stop by and check It out.","2014-04-30","0","6OjPcTK1pN7QlLFOI9VQYQ","6HDlC3HKFwOtxLHxv-ra_g"

"The absolute worst service. DO NOT EVER COME HERE. They are just out to get your money. My BF broke his screen on his IPhone 6 Plus. Went in and got it replaced here because it was the cheapest ""$125"" A week later his screen popped (today 11\/10\/15) out and shattered. Called back to get a refund or replaced, but no luck. We are taking them to small claims court. Apparently this isn't the first time, lots of people have been screwed by this company.

HOWEVER, the draft beer is a welcome addition to a movie theatre menu :-) , the screen is small but good enough for a drama or similar movie,  the seats are ok,  yes they recline and are far from each other therefore you don't have to fight for elbow room or accidentally kick the seat in front of you...  but I did find the seats tiring after about an hour.","2013-05-23","0","zoODlH40edpJYLPLkHilNA","oGkWRSFBhVJgXn37KBy1cA"

The price of this buffet for dinner is absolutely affordable and is of high quality, variety and flavor. It's $12 per person if you don't have a players card, cheaper even so if you do. 2. Most importantly. They offer oxtail stew on certain nights and it is is superb and worth the $12 alone.

"11\/22\/16. Tuesday. Today is the BIG day! The name and mascot reveal of the new Las Vegas NHL team, whose home ice will be inside this arena, will take place this afternoon at 5:30 in Toshiba Plaza! Afterwards, the public and season ticket holders will be able to tour the arena and purchase brand new Las Vegas (name of NHL team) merchandise here and at various points in Toshiba Plaza. This is an exciting time for Vegas. The first, but probably not the last, of the four major sports, arrives today","2016-11-22","0","sk0stgY4NDJYOX1MbNJ3Pg","_-oTR-yaPtsgm5OGFFzr_g"

Fantastic! I almost cancelled my appointment because I had to work and couldn't leave to pick up my car. Helen tells me no problem she can drop the car off to me. I tried to pay first and she refused and said that they will collect after the job is done.

Am not into sea food , so I stuck with the cooler menu. I was impressed. No fish taste at all, or the after taste. They literally have an entire pig head but you have to call and reserve atleast 24 hours ahead of time.  Good selection of Japanese beer and drinks.
