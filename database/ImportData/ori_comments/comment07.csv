"Awesome place to unwind after a long day! Business professionals hangout around the ""indoor\/outdoor"" bar. Great place to meet new friends (old & young). The happy hour prices are on point! ...and the food is always good. Wanted a Riesling, but they were out of stock! :-(  I settle for a plum wine considering I like sweet, white wines. It was awesome!

I'm STILL a fan! :-)","2014-05-13","0","H3Gastz2T6iiSRGmlbtoXQ","5-ni6jRdBKI4I6ZVMpMIxQ"

"After having a tasty dinner at Short Leash hotdogs my taste buds wanted something sweet (I know Pie Hole is next door but not in mood for pie)...found it at MELT! Had their strawberry ice cream, my hubby got super farm: chocolate hazelnuts and nutella! We met the friendly owner who was working the late shift and who has a 9month old at home, you go Crystal! Def will visit again:)","2013-08-17","0","3saG51hM2M14G5f-QwhGhg","ASNDUhvAwDsEtaGwAjH8BQ"
"Chicago style hotdogs?

Now they are using their house made English Muffin, which is sturdy like a Biscuit. Plus you get more fruit now. No more soggy! Much better option. I just get it without mayo. I think the melted cheese is sufficient.","2015-04-29","0","mGRUkg7YO1fWpfYCqNcR-g","d_IFkIwz3jzt6yRIpTttsQ"

"I have been coming here for a long time something like 7yrs maybe longer.  The guys here are awesome. They know how to cut hair and they remember how I like it everytime I come in. I like when they finish cutting my hair they put a hot towel on  my head and give a short power massage. However I think they should massage the head too so it can stimulate the scalp for more hair growth. I will have to ask them next time I can't believe that I just thought of that.

I've never had to wait much more than a few mins for my order. Even when they are super-bizzzy they're still real fast. My 8 shot americono order is always perfect.

Almost everything for this meal can be found in 99 Cents Only: eggs, cheese, onions, garlic, potatoes, spinach and cracked black pepper for the frittata. The croissant is a Costco find--although 99 has them from time to time. The asparagus is pan-seared with garlic and sea salt. The glass plate is also from 99!","2013-10-10","0","ItDwcFs-HTeQHXBbONp_0w","CL0RX4eyVpUzd2R-fldELg"

"After spending a day talking to Rudi and his sales Manger via email. We had agreed on a price on a car I liked and have driven in the past. It was to be a 1,2,3 deal. Drove from Gilbert to Phoenix only to walk out few min later. They took out the video monitorscreams and car was not the clean CPO it was advertised. Also they wanted to raise the price.  Never ever will I go back. Extremely bad experience.  Crooks... liers.... we have stellar credit had no issues with that.

"Horrible experience dealing with this place.   Brought in a trimmer that was stalled out and needed a carb clean.  They called me a week later to give me and estimate of 110-130 dollars.  Which is ridiculous for this service should be about 50 bucks.  Then charged me $18 for the diagnosis which I already new. then owner suggested I just not pay the $18 fee because the trimmer wasn't worth it since it wasn't working.

I'm from NYC and let me assure you this place is 100% false advertising with its name. bland taste, old, no tomato sauce at all and barely any cheese. This isn't even good compared to other pizza restaurants in Arizona and I think pizza in AZ is usually not too good compared to NYC pizza but this place is even bad compared to other AZ pizza places.

When the pizza arrived it was room temp. The cheese had already congealed.

"Great spot!! Inside is very modern and clean. Very open and welcoming. Being a vegan, options aren't always easy to come by. The menu doesn't specify vegan options, but the lovely and friendly waitress was incredibly accommodating making veggie spring rolls and Pho made with veggie broth an option for me. She was very attentive and genuinely took an interest to your opinion of the meal. Drinks were filled promptly as well. Good prices too! Nothing negative to say; will definitely be back!","2014-06-11","0","W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g","WPE_9L3Ncuqg5vw93jK9iQ"

"My whole family (w a couple picky eaters + me, vegan) enjoyed this place. Good food- might take awhile or have an awkward server (albeit always personable and well-meaning). Overall, a good local Italian joint- not the mass-market broad-appeal of Olive Garden, but a more homey, yet still accommodating pizza place. This is the place you want to patronize- a local pizza place, making good food, who also go out of their way to cater to vegan and\/or gluten-free folks.","2016-04-30","0","7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA","hB216b7iW-pEAUuAXS41Tw"

Research the #Djorddevich family THEY OWN OTHER PLACES in the Valley!! This place is uninhabitable and to have the gall to delay immediate A\/C repair in this weather is INEXCUSABLE

P.S. If any of your reps has the GALL to respond to me before you spend a SECOND fixing their A\/C, u can kindly throw yourself in a wood chipper","2016-08-06","0","UZnRFT-Prbmraodlhar69g","hB216b7iW-pEAUuAXS41Tw"

Surprisingly roasted green pepper flavor rocked the whole bowl!! Clean, crisp, fresh... Big serving one you know you can't eat it all and then it's so good you take just one more bite, then another & another.

"At first glance menu, decor, location seems ideal... Don't be deceived! Service is sub par, had to get up to get staff for forgotten guacamole. Which was fresh but too tart, no flavor. Salsa trio ok, prob good if drinking! Waiter did apologize & try to make right. Then it took forever like 25 min for 3 simple taco orders. They did bring us extra salsa. Food still isn't here but even if its good, I won't be back or recommend.  Decor is great & patio. Maybe it's best for just margaritas.","2013-07-17","0","ibf4xvHWD4t1DOOZhidHBg","N_CgPQZH5YaBfY3dTfi-Jw"

"Food finally arrived & we were shocked at quality for length of time.  2-3 star quality & taste. We left half of guacamole uneaten. The waiter did keep asking & getting whatever we wanted. He explained it was more a bar with bites. That helped & drinking would too. Manager was great & unnecessarily comped our meal &  got our concerns. She offered a coupon to return that we declined, but we aren't drinkers. Go for the tequila & chips & environment. Kids Flauta was good.","2013-07-17","0","ibf4xvHWD4t1DOOZhidHBg","N_CgPQZH5YaBfY3dTfi-Jw"

This turned out to be a good choice. The burger is done perfectly and was seasoned great. The chili fries are enough for up to three people but I polished them off all by myself.

THERE IS NOTHING NEW YORK ABOUT IT!!! ITS DISGUSTING TASTED LIKE I PICKED IT FROM THE TRASH!!!  It was stale there was NO FLAVOR Hardly NO SAUCE on the pizza the cheese tasted old  worst than school pizza.

"Tried something new, not a bad choice. Inexpensive, different & pretty good. I appreciated the samples for newbies. The only downside to our meal was the selection (or lack of) eating utensils. I don't mind plastic but, they were extremely flimsy. Rather the spoon was flimsy; they didn't offer forks (insert puzzled look). 

Ordered a combo: Diablo Chicken (lightly fried), Gringo Chicken Quesadilla w\/White Rice & Cuban Black Beans. Just the right amount of food. Would definitely return.","2014-02-22","0","l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA","cvAPwZRWaDxSUudy8CR3Rw"

"Can't even get a call to go go through. 

I managed to get into the call back que shortly after the lines opened, told a 15 minute callback time. 1 1\/2 hours later - NOTHING.","2017-07-24","0","ugLQ5AP7pSrCb0uMhS-UXg","XjGIyXceQhV1bM4foiC9oA"
"Disregard ANY average or less than average reviews. 

""Blaze"" the bartender is ALWAYS attentive and spot on with our orders and service. The food is of very high quality and portions served. I lived in Hong Kong back when it was a British Colony and the first time I had the Fried Rice - it was an instant flashback to late night excursions in Wanchai and chowing down on some fried rice after a few pints!!!  You will not go wrong giving Flo's a try.","2017-09-11","0","yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A","XjGIyXceQhV1bM4foiC9oA"
