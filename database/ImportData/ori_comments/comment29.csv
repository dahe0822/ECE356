Let's be mindful of the type of customers you're dealing with... working estimates all day is stressful and doesn't make any money. 

If you want to establish a relationship with a mechanic then learn to trust someone

If you're looking for the cheapest option and don't want to invest then learn how to do it yourself (but you can't HAHA)

"Cute and quirky hidden cafe right by\/technically still on Ryerson. The baristas are super friendly and will entertain you with their behind the counter banter and dance moves to the music on their bomb playlists. The vibes are great for hanging out or meeting up. Because their playlists are so sick, and if youre anything like me, you won't get too much work done as you'll end up singing and jamming along with the staff and fellow patrons in the cafe","2016-11-15","0","HkPnai4LMRjAYZkZ2AQLkA","T3wPb8s6ucjP2mBgOA7NoQ"

"Their mini cakes are good. The only complain I have is that there seems to be no system in ordering. Today, being a Saturday, the place was busy but it is a bit annoying that for one person to order desserts, you have to go to one side, and to order the sandwiches you have to go to the opposite side. IMHO it is a bad design, and they have quite a few people working there but it seemed like they themselves do not know which customer to serve first. Other than that, coffee and cakes were good.","2013-04-20","0","9EWqMUCkQNfRUELiIEA8Iw","s1XTZINUXibQEfbCvRKBMg"

"We went here for ayce lunch and the food was alright. The bubble tea is absolutely terrible and expensive, there are plenty of other bubble tea places that are way better. 

The service came often but when it comes to fixing bad drinks don't expect them to give you a reasonable resolution. I ordered the bubble tea and the tapioca was undercooked. They took it and microwaved it, it was still garbage. Then they told me ""Then don't buy bubble tea next time"". I'm definitely not coming back.","2013-05-17","0","DYeqmpmGgCDaPD6u0nxYLA","EFs_KCAxdoIRmVe3z08rsw"

"Horrible experience. Went yesterday night at 9, requested for a booth, waited for a few minutes. Waited for our food, we ordered szechuan beef with rice noodle and beef with chili black bean sauce. Waited 25 mins before I asked the waitress where our food was.... It was forgotten, it came out 5 mins later without the noodle we told them and they fixed it 10 Later and our second dish came out. We also ordered a bowl of rice n even that took 10 mins. Never again will I go to a congee wong.","2013-07-14","0","r1SfvWKoRQcoMoGy9ou-JA","ldbQ6iN7PYZl-1YCATvUSQ"

This place is great if ur looking for an affordable deep tissue massage but its the only thing you're looking for, no bells and whistles, not a relaxing day spa, only for massages.

"I go get facials about once every two months, so I found this place on google and decided to give it a shot since the price was alright. It was interesting because they offer different products for smokers vs non smokers. The only turn off I have to say about the facial was that they wore gloves... & every time they patted me on the fAce with a different product I found the glove would stick to my face. Overall I didn't find this place any different from other spas.& No change rooms or lockers.","2013-06-05","0","4VnbWBIYeCZRy6Xjn00dLQ","lQ6TX1-hNYNuLJscEiUqZg"

"This place is highly disturbing if you have a peanut allergy. I went in ordered a burger and fries only to notice two hugs bags of peanuts sitting on top of bags of potatoes. I have had two emergency room visits due to peanuts, yet these idiots have it on display as if it's some menu item when it's not. Needless to say I cancelled my order and walked out. With so many people nowadays deathly allergic to this substance you would think franchises knew better.","2013-07-29","0","phEpLAtmM4_8u1M7uGU43A","uf3I2YU0Yiz7wziw7co_Mg"

"Outrageous prices for the size of the meal, 10 to 13$ for a burger without fries or a drink!!!! Who do these people think they are? I ordered the raging bull which was tasty but greasy as hell and the hamburger bun fell apart and was squishy in my hands. If I wanted this kind of pathetic bread I would have eaten at mcdonalds or burger king. On second thought I cant really tell how good the meat tasted since it was smothered in Chipotle sauce.","2013-08-30","1","67Pa_CtXthgJzXfY8JzLDQ","uf3I2YU0Yiz7wziw7co_Mg"

"1. If you are traveling a distance when you order take out get the sauce for your sandwiches on the side.

2. If you are unsure on how hot you want your sandwich then get the hot on side option.

3. If you like your food well done then ask the server to add a note to the order.

4. Mention if you want Sweet, Medium, or HOT at the beginning of each sandwich! I noticed that when I do this there are never any errors in my order.

"All the comments are about feeling welcome, other than places that carry large amounts of wedding dresses on stock you can't just walk in. MOST if not ALL bridal boutiques are by appointment only.

Word of caution: They only have Beef\/lamb and no chicken item what so ever; therefore, it may not be suitable for everyone. No tax.","2015-01-16","0","M3VcPBiMvhsEJSGUHvXu2w","_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg"
"Bland food... mostly dehydrated due to sitting in burners for a long time. All fried items for some reason are left on burner-less sort of huge table kinda platters therefore those items are cold. Falafels, veggies items, meat items are semi-cold . I donno why would u waste $30 bucks per person. Not to mention the semi nude dancer that burns ur eyes.

I thought the food was good but I have definitely had better. The wings were excellent as was the coleslaw. I was hoping the ribs would have been better.

Although their extensive wine menu was impressing. When I ordered my Cabernet Franc; which they listed.... They didn't have it. So I ordered the next best thing and again they didn't have it.

Don't be fooled by a good rating as if you use a rest room in a restaurant and the bathroom is filthy more likely a chance that their food preparation is just as bad. I ordered toast.

"Arrived with friend at 9:45 pm. By 10:30 were told that they are closing the kitchen, and that they close at 11.  15 minutes later asked us to pay. We understood but didn't expect what happened  next- 10 minutes to 11 were asked to leave!! at some point they  were mumbling something whenever we called them, talked about us, maybe cursed and were angry when we didn't understand how they can kick customers out.     Food was nothing special either!  Awful service.  Will never go back!!","2016-07-30","0","gcrez7gs0uWy-l9qYvY39Q","gZmcnW8EK9O0XKWYb-Biog"

"Had Juicy Lucy with poutine. 
Positives:
+Halal
+Friendly staff
+Fast service
+ Decent burger
+ Good concept with cheese filling

Negatives:
- Burger meat was fatty
- Burger felt cold because of condiments.
- Poutine was not good 
- Expensive when you add combo 

Good place to try Halal or burger with cheese filling. But there are better other places to try as well. But not bad for a quick bite.

"I went there today for my first time & got a shellac manicure & basic spa pedicure. 
It was amazing. The owner & everyone else there is very friendly and welcoming, which is always good to first time costumes. 
The biggest thing that impressed me is the level of cleanliness. I go to a lot of spas but 221 is by far the most clean & sanitary place I've been too. You see all the tools coming out of a sanitary container & always mentioning the importance of being clean. 
HIGHLY recommend!!!","2013-09-20","0","akECN1kRpGUnYGabb979PQ","_MFx-KHu_c4QyOSQ-kEi2A"

He said if u can afford $5, which I am sure you cannot afford, pay it. It was not about the money but abt the principle.

I have short shoulder length hair and for 45 dollars and no wash I felt completely ripped off as the hair style looked worse than something someone would do by themselves at home.

The appetizers were great! Everything was freshly made to order and each order came with tahini sauce and fresh salad. The appetizers came with a lot of pita bread but it wasn't anything special. I recommend making a sandwich with the falafel, fried eggplant, foul medammes and tahini sauce....yum!","2013-06-27","0","FFM_S2cAA20-cxxVJ55iRA","MgNkhX_twE5Gp9BK-yWZPQ"

Front Desk: rude and unfriendly to the point online booking service has better service.

Atmosphere: unprofessional. One stylist felt the need to discuss his friend's R-rated  love life with me. 

Sanitation - questionable as they don't appear to clean their tools between clients. 

Quality of cut - Bangs aren't a forte. 

If you like being treated well, a wholesome atmosphere, and a decent cut - avoid this place.","2013-12-15","0","x1qPozYmiAQRe02JKzgmtA","F1YBhpgmFIBFfyHNiVaCzA"

My wife proposed to order small portions (and lucky we were). 
Best part was the service, the food was tasteless and bad and over priced.

"A late order in for pick up, not having much of choice around so thought why not.

Had a small conversation with the manager and looked straight to his face and told him, customers come back if the quality of food is good and it remains consistent. The manager paused for a moment and said its good, it looked like a vital sign of ""oh crap, you won't forget us, ever"". 

So true, right on his words, felt blotted, like a lot of msg added, heart burns, upset stomach. Atrocious !!!!","2013-07-27","1","pi6nzMtV0WHKGTjsTfaafQ","6h-0lVxAWgsClGzevN4HJw"
"If you are looking for an place with exotic food and warm hospitality, this is the place to be. Servers had the warmth and served with their hearts. 
Being vegetarian, was provided with recommendations from the server, and was assured it would be amazing. The food did stay to the word. 
Do try the Moroccan tea, it's refreshing.

The food was tantalizing on the pallets and did give the exotic flavours. It felt like an exotic adventure.

"More a place to come because everyone else does...  for the prices that are charged I expect way more food.  Tip:  go to a grocery store and spend the same... it would feed you breakfast for 2 weeks.   Good food but prices are not nearly worth it.","2013-01-06","0","jbEUkJkX2yqCwQAHz6YV0g","5qe-Qj7SS1tlkGfK2pOqOg"

Went for a pedicure, SONNY scrubeed my feet very hard with some dirty files, bleed 2 of my toes\/ripped the skin around them.
I didn't say anything because l just wanted to leave asap, he applied nail polish on my nails AND skin around them.
When he was done l looked at it and asked him if he can clean up the nail polish from around my nails and he just smudged it and left.
DISGUSTING!!!

"You'll want to try everything! But surviving an AYCE restaurant takes some planning. I'd recommend starting with the ""lighter"" Japanese selections (sashimi and sushi), and then moving on to some hot protein dishes (BBQ beef, calamari, maybe a noodle dish with some chicken, and then the heavier dishes such a butter chicken, Thai curries or the seafood casserole.  If you still have room for dessert after all that, more power to you!","2014-08-01","0","MM5Fdfqf87QpTkHIKZNVdg","br9hkOIpT6aOjvejelkGKQ"

NO garnishes on any of our drinks, daiquiri was extremely sweet, waitress was too occupied with other employees, and we asked for water and never received that.

However, I must say the food was pretty good Steak perfectly cooked and crab dip with pita bread was delicious.","2013-07-05","0","r4VrYDgpOYKDrnteHgJ9YA","4EXdqJAi9O4DQf3lw1jJtA"

Sales reps are good but the dealership will Nickel and dime you every step of the way.

"Worst service! After nearly 40 minutes waiting in line; we finally got to the ticket office and they said: 'we're sold out for that screen... we have a FEW spots for this one...' seriously? Is it too hard to change the sign at the entrance and let people know (before they try to get in) what's actually available?... we left and there were at least 50 more cars in line. 
Also, control the line... there's cars getting in through the exit, sneaking out the line.","2017-07-29","0","o90H4ryS1MmRaXKtExgP1w","40RAXJOm7SfqwCAI8FEzyA"

We asked to be moved as we saw other tables that were empty and much better sititutated .Great service from our friendly server (Nic). The food was not great, we sent the pizza back because it was dry and burnt on the bottom.

Superior food Quality and unbelievable fresh taste.
They dont look to be the ""Fancy place"" where you can eat ordinary meals and then pay close to 100 $ at the end for two people.  They want to just make you happy with their freshmade and traditionally italian cousin !

"I was driving  alone Eglinton to find a place to eat, stopped stopped by Kelsey after working a long day at work. The service was great the food was nothing to rave or brag about. Our server Anna was very polite and understanding. I ordered a steak that was over cooked, she took it back and apologized and gave a estimated time when I the new one would be ready.  The food quality needs improvement","2014-05-01","0","oi5BvNYKud9bGC74XcnwEA","vxyj-QgDKVnsaeTBLTEq0g"
"Raspberry Blush Sangria and Oreo Cookie Shake! $5 Sangria everyday. The service amazing is always amazing. For some reason today I had to send Scallop Carbonara back twice!  The third time it was much better. The manager came over and explained that they have changed suppliers and that it's been a working progress. It's completely understandable coming from the food and hospitality industry myself.
