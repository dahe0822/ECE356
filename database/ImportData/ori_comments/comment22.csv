"Go to another Louboutin store. The sales lady here is very judgemental and I honestly never received such horrible service. I'm used to sales reps from CL to be super helpful, courteous and patient. I mean I'm about to spend a couple thousand dollars. I know I walked in with a jersey and some jeans, but never judge a book by its cover. Wish I got her name that way I can put it here, but she isn't worth my time. I went to Crystals to buy me shoes. Go there! The sales ladies are much much nicer!!","2016-11-21","0","nXfTvWaTLxF1koYurYDAZQ","RwBO2Qupt5rrXe13RsUYPA"

"Flight was smooth however, the crew did a poor job of cleaning up the aircraft.  What I didn't like is we had taxied out and we're out there for about thirty minutes and we had to go back to the terminal to get more fuel because they didn't have enough fuel because they had to file a new flight plan because of weather in the area.  They knew about the weather before and they didn't do anything about it.  It was poor planning on there part to waste fuel.","2014-07-06","0","z7GAft_JrFNmAH5xbVeYSA","4Z70lDXnO5SskT6neJ8hNw"

"@ Donna E.  As a gay guy who goes to the Rabbit several times a week you're out of your mind. It's an extremely welcoming bar to everyone - and I mean EVERYONE.  If you get into other Vegas bars with broken out-of-state IDs more power to you. But they followed the law. And they were not rude to you nor did they use the language you claim. They are welcoming people - the owners and their employees.  It's my favorite bar in town.  Don't be angry then make untrue claims because of it. Not fair.","2013-07-20","0","9p-cpmHaga-EXyc6ZzYCcQ","-9tvXZauwIIpyy9J-moV6A"

Now its $22 a night. Total rip off for shit I don't even use. Oh and the beds are the most uncomfortable on the strip you get a thin hard little pad with 2 sheets to keep you from feeling how hard the blanket is.

"I came here to gamble on the crap tables. In a casino you are allowed to smoke cigarettes. One of the dealers named ""Gina"" told me to blow my electronic cigarette vapor the other way. I felt very uncomfortable. She would constantly tell me to stop vaping by her if the vapor did get in her way, I can't control that! I was even polite enough to tell her sorry! That's just me coming from hawaii, we are polite! If you don't like smoke don't work in a casino!

It was served hot and a great change of pace having shredded fresh corned beef with cheese. It's like a breakfast Ruben. The potatoes were OK, they aren't what I like. I like fresh potatoes not ones from a bag...

Room is clean and nice but now bass is booming through the floor of the room at 1:30am. I usually like a place that is old school and has character but I need a shower just walking through hotel!

"I really love this place. Definitely your winter dine if you crave something that will keep you warm and fulfilled. I personally recommend their spicy Mabo Tofu Ramen, although not for non-spicy food cravers, its still an awesome dish. The menu is great and theres still a variety of amazing ramen to choose from. The gyoza is actually pretty good as well :) as for their servers? I believe Bier was her name... she was very laidback, informative and awesome.","2013-09-17","0","ilKfISetU1EgKMIJj9euAw","JqGY0RuoTDMLxgsD49rkaw"

"They recently changed the Caesar Salad recipe, and not for the better. Gone was the Parmesan cheese, replaced by a ""shaved blend"". The shavings don't mix with the greens well so you have to fight to get them. And the flavor paled. Dressing was also lighter than before.

If you waive to have your room made, you get a $10 food credit which you can use at any restaurants at westgate and you can get starbu ks coffee and a pastry and that $10 is for before tax so if your coffee is $5.95 and coffee cake is $4 your $10 coupon pays for it and you dont have to pay 75 cents for tax.","2017-10-21","0","yhgUyctWczUN13MinNgZ3w","o1M_t0v4DywPKLr7XxkAAg"

I have never experienced a ""limit"" on a Champagne Brunch ~ @ Main St. Station or anywhere else in the past 20 years.  

My most recent experience spanned the last 2 hours of Brunch, + 1 hour or more into Dinner.  

Server brought my Mimosas & my friend's Champagne after we had filled our plates.  Then every 15-20 minutes, she refilled, & even brought fresh glasses twice.  

Dinner Server arrived @ Shift Change, & she kept filling our glasses through Dessert.  We tipped both generously.","2017-06-24","0","EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw","flxyHLLQraTnd_z0_OmTvw"

Especially the flavors in Kalbi, wow!  And Rice cake desserts are very good with either vanilla or green tea ice creams.  Also, price is reasonable service is great! This is not all you can eat so you will for sure get better quality meats!

"NOT at all disappointed! Very good Italian food - I had the caprese app, artichoke app, and the pasta pomodoro. All were fantastic. The artichoke is a whole one, steam boiled and then stuffed, sitting in butter and garlic. Mmmmmmmm I couldn't stop eating! Caprese was a regular caprese but enough to share with 3 other people. Pasta was also delicious, creamy and spot on flavor. And huge portions so I am taking a lot home to eat tomorrow.

"This place is as good of massage place as any in Las Vegas. The staff, though some may have a language barrier, are very nice and attentive. My time there was very relaxing and there were no sudden noises like the negative reviews.   If there happens to be a loud noise please take note that they are between a Panda Express and an Ethiopian restaurant; it may get rowdy around lunch time.","2016-06-11","0","wiXeRnQMpG2VVtamiIvT6Q","0fAd93gaK3JOeAF0sCZT9Q"

"I stopped by Friday night 10\/18 the bar tender was Teah  I stood at the bar quite a while waiting to order. They were filming something as they had 3 cameras set up and lights etc. I was eventually acknowledged but only to be told I was in the cameras way. Well they have amazing food and drinks every time I go and Bill is working. However the poor service and general idea of being told I was in the way will keep me out anytime I see her behind the bar.","2013-10-19","0","iAu8s96GKQ73Xe7j_2GyCQ","aPyuy0CQObjTUwfOP7f7Ug"

"This bank and it's staff are horrible.  On two different occasions I went in there to make a withdrawal and was told that I couldn't have access to MY MONEY because their system waa down.  What I thought was funny is that the people went in there to make deposits and oh yes they would take your money but they couldn't give me mine.  Even if I wanted to close my account they still would not allow me access to what is rightfully mine.  I will no longer be banking there.

"my new favorite restaurant of all time. I had the greatest dinner of my life. the fresh portabello mushrooms were amazing in the homemade pasta. the filet migon was out of this world! easily the best meal of my life","2012-10-20","0","DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw","BU4upf9mXlACVYf-Tr7qJQ"
"All the top chefs in Vegas are missing a key ingredient, homemade ingredients from a chef\/owner who personally makes or oversees your meal! The pasta is made fresh and is phenomenal but you must also have the Veal Reale, superb! Our server, Ann was extremely knowledgable and attentive! Nothing about this place is ordinary, all was outstanding! Highly recommend having an enjoyable dinner at Ferraros!","2013-04-28","0","DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw","je_BZaIFsYPYJkZcBYHxRQ"

"Big place but not enough actual arcade games. Bar and restaurant area takes up half the space.  E Sports room pretty cool $5 per hour. There are 10 bowling lanes. $5 per game $4 for shoes.  Yikes! Very expensive.  Nice addition to Town Square but they will definitely need to make some changes to please the locals.","2014-08-05","0","n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA","sjzv-c1k_HGGT9vZbfimWw"

"Pretty busy spot.  Went there for brunch date w\/ hubby Monday 10am. Short line waited about 10 mins. Service was fast and friendly.  Prices are little higher cause it's on the strip. Pancakes are huge not the best. Scrambles were good. French press coffee is delish. Bloody mary wss jus meh...overall I'd give it 3 stars.","2014-10-06","0","QGAv-8tj5i4m4G-HDMnIbA","sjzv-c1k_HGGT9vZbfimWw"

After a long wait (and after three people cut in front of me, since there are too many lines to reception), I was first called ""sir"" out of habit apparently, then I was called ""sensitive"" by another customer service rep.

My son had the chicken red curry. The course came with a nice veggie soup, rice and had good proportions.  All delicious and priced at a very good value for you buck.

Picón is a three milk blue cheese from the mountains of Picos de Europa in Spain. It's texture was creamy and the taste tangy. The white color was offset with blueish-green veins and a gray rind with yellowish-green spots. Excellente!!

"This morning, I just saw Sushi 21 featured on the Dirty Dining segment on KTNV 13 (ABC) as repeat offenders for health violations.  Roaches, old chicken under work surfaces, dirty ice machine... and that wasn't the worst photos they showed. 

They were shut down on 11\/2 and reinspected and reopened on 11\/4.  Look this up:

This is my first tattoo so I'm not sure if this is how it works out or if people are just telling me to comfort me a little, but I'm really hoping it thins out because the dagger keeps getting mistaken for a wand and I hope it just gets 10x more sharp and visible.

"(Update) This place is CRAP. They changed their menu prices and got rid of the buffet. -- Cheap buffet. The coconut curry chicken on the buffet is the star of the show. Very filling. I only had 1 big plate. Rice was soft and perfect, not dried out like a lot of Asian places have.

The waitress said in order to get the deal I have to buy a drink, even a non alcoholic drink is expensive there so I didn't really save any money and felt lame for having to purchase a drink when I just wanted water. *this time I ordered milk. It went perfectly w the meal and kept my bill at $10 :) I love this deal","2015-02-05","0","BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ","RSy3PjxNFHVz0kum4OE3LQ"

"Pleasantly surprised,  wasn't sure what to expect from previous reviews.

Had room 3454 in the carnival tower, not a great view but the room is great.  Very clean, updated.

Service has been spectacular.  Had a member of our party slip in the bathtub, harrahs staff all over it.

Would definitely return, great location.","2013-04-13","0","NY80DkkCfEl198JmwtO4pA","PRtMSAiuViehepUxenp0yw"

"Rude cocktail waitress that ignored me when she took orders at the poker table. She helped all the men. While she was dropping off the drinks I began to request a beverage and she cut me off mid sentence to say she would be back. I was a bartender\/bar manager and cocktail waitress for 8 plus years. What a jerk. That's her. Management should really speak to her about client service. So rude. Doesn't smile either","2017-05-05","0","AV6weBrZFFBfRGCbcRGO4g","WW8jaGsBh9_rYcVSbEjLiQ"

"Had a Earl's Club $6.50 + $1 for avacado liked it! Did not like the flat look of the bread. But it was crunchy on the out side and had that important chewy softness on the inside. The bread was a small bit of a surprise. Had the Chicken Tortila soup , was a little spicy and salty but I liked it.  Deserves the 4 star sandwitch rates.  But great I am not so sure.   imho. Carnage Deli is great. Going for the first time to the LV loc tomorrow.","2013-06-04","0","DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw","UeSxysKsuBt-eRp6rLQ0Mg"
