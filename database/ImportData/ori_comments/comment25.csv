They don't even have napkins on the table when we first arrive... Pepper n salt don't have labels on them. The service is very slow! There r like so many empty tables n waiters, but none of them notice us when we want napkins.","2013-11-27","0","OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw","dGhbcL7yKIxFNJWiw-LfNQ"

large chicken combo is a better deal. It comes with 4 strips and has the larger drink. The smaller combo only has 2 strips and a small child sized drink.

"I ordered the shrimp ceviche, Dixie fried chicken and a kale salad.
Honestly it reminds me of an old Country Kitchen that turned the lights down, added some funky music, trained the staff, fluffed the menu with some buzz food items that lack flavor and added alcohol.

"Walked in sat at the bar alone and was completely ignored..no hello. No smile. Bartender finally acknowledged I was alive and sitting at his bar, still didn't speak, smile or say hello. Began to wipe down my bar area and instead of speaking, smiling or saying hello he gave me a thumb up gesture to move my cell phone so he could wipe under it. I am not a mime, some friendly human interaction would have been lovely. I walked out. Learn to speak mime Bartender.

It was bunch of naked people jumping into water.  There were no complete story hard to follow.  I strongly did't feel it was worth the $ Tickets were very pricey.  I don't recommend to kids less 10.

We are 3 small girls, why on earth would the server automatically assume we wanted double burgers? Then, we charged extra because they were made doubles. The fries were also cold and when we tried to tell the server she started to walk away like she didn't hear us.

"I'll have to check later as to whether $100 NON-REFUNDABLE pet deposit-was covered; if so, NOT very prominently. I consider it deceptive, you be your OWN judge. 

They act like they're doing me a favor cuz other Marriott brands don't take pets. But I've traveled w\/ Max before & NEVER have paid ANY deposit, let alone non-refundable.

My fish was ok but had to blot out the grease on my napkin.  My daughter asked for chips and salsa plus a burger.  She never got the chips and salsa and her onion rings were very salty and greasy.  Mcdonald's fish sandwich was better than my fish.  Service was mediocre at best.","2013-03-28","0","05BpxQYVbywxliQ9yA0CKw","E4b5cecaysq5sMo9K-ZVwg"

"2Nd time eating here today.1st time was great but now i dont think so. My husband ordered chicken fried steak. The gravey tasted very strange. He scraped most of it off & continued 2eat. I ate1\/2half of 1 of his hashbrown paties which had some gravey on it . W\/in 30 mins i threw up ,w\/in 1hr he also did the same & has not stoped all day vomiting.  I finally called & spoke 2a manager, the lady was nice &suggested  i call the operarions manager. I said no . but u need thow that gravey shit away!!","2014-03-17","0","3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg","tRXe5HRTDsUNqL3yNSquMw"

Kept me on hold for 30 mins. The reason why I called was because I was missing rice for two of the dishes and one dish wasn't even enough for my 4yr old and paid almost $10 for it.

"Go for the Whole Hawg so everyone can share and taste everything. Vanessa was awesome and took great care of us. Dad says it was ""Just Good!"", bring both hands for the cornbread says the husband, and don't forget your appetite for some of the juiciest smokiest pork and beef ribs, pulled pork and slow roasted chicken ever. Mac and cheese to take note of. Wash it down with Bobby's own Amber. Cinnamon sugar donuts...the end.","2013-12-26","0","VyVIneSU7XAWgMBllI6LnQ","Lh5cOrtYyu_K2I2Tykp1Mw"

"The brisket is really good and brittle, probably better off getting a brisket sand which. The 3 meat platter is really good, gives you an idea of what you will most likely get the second time around. And after trying between the sausage, brisket and ribs, ribs definitely take the cake! Corn bread is also good as an appetizer, and the grilled veggies really had some good flavor as we'll. The sauces are really good to I suggest the spicy, and at the end we got mini sugar donuts!

"Well considering this place has amazing yelp ratings and that is the ONLY reason why i took my Black lab here for her vet visit they shocked me when my dog had diahrea for 3 days and besides a stool sample which made total sense to me...they wanted to take xrays. Yet my dog had no blood in her stool, and she was eating and drinking and showes no signs of distress they were demanding she get an xray. This place is money hungry and not very caring in my book. I will be finding a new vet...","2013-07-12","0","1VCCa_oLqO94Wh8hTyMD-A","EoDVa1xeOQVzfVSeCJZPbg"

"Slow service, and every time we come here they screw up the order.  The language barrier is so significant they don't seem to understand what we want when we order.  Additionally, we always have to ask for forks and knives.  It's as though we are expected to eat with our fingers.  The place has potential but management seems persistent in making sure this place fails.  It's sad!","2013-09-15","0","_sh6mIBWZis66mAjkjN8Qg","YV005mGNPaTciBry-Qu9og"

Our 7 yr old daughter ate 1 & thought Takkis were hotter than these ""suicide"" wings. I got the Greek flatbread salad w\/ chicken & it was good w\/ my own dressing oil, vinegar and lemon.

"Just lefr this store... stood in the middle of the store for 15 minutes for someone to help me. No luck,  it seems as if the incoming phone calls were more important than customers in the store waiting. I stood there while an available associate was walking around, and as soon as the phone rang ""Jordan"" quickly assisted them before people in the store. So I figured the only way to get help was to call. So I did from outside the store and got the ""help"" that I didn't receive in the store.

"I don't know what everyone else was talking about. I still went, despite the 50% negative reviews, and I was impressed. It is clean, big, plentiful, and I had four plates of just lobster tails! So I probably ate more than enough to cover the $40 charge. If you love seafood you should definitely go, it's tricky getting to the rio from the strip, but we managed hopping two free shuttles. We came from trump, shuttled to ceasers, shuttled to palms, then walked about 1\/4 mile to rio. Piece of cake!","2013-04-14","0","rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw","x9eStKbxARIhyFpCYjuLRg"

The girls are friends and word travels fast. Shitty customers drive the atmosphere down for everyone. If your not interested say No. Your not hurting anyone's feelings.

It creates a burden for the owneowners\/waiter\/waitress to clean more than they should. I hate to see Ben Thanh losing business due to people that dont respect the restaurant.

"HT is one of my faves, however this specific location is worst by far. Every.single.time. It's a joke; an oft-spoken topic this location is insanely slow at service (not server fault; it's the kitchen). It doesn't matter what time of day; your food will take at least 30 min, most times much longer.  However, Mooresville, Asheville, Huntersville HT's are awesome, both in speed and service. This restaurant is clearly run by someone different than other close locations. Not near as clean either.","2016-11-27","0","iXH73faCXa6UdLAKMe-vGQ","tNt5UvYAqO6vJfEiw2WMEQ"

"Hi There,

Great food with fabulous service. Oh, and the view is unsurpassed. The food price has the admission to the observation deck etc.  Great deal if you look at in that way.  On thing I didn't see in other reviews was the fact you are on a rotating floor which ensures you see the strip at least once every hour and a bit. Have a great time :)

There is no drink limit but if you do order just be wary that your bill can rack up pretty high if you're not careful.

"A cold rainy night in Las Vegas.  Our first trip to Fukumimi Ramen.  It's a small strip mall place but don't let that fool you. I had the namesake Fukumimi Ramen with pork belly slices, a spiced egg half, sea weed, green onions, and an absolutely great broth.  My wife had the Kara Miso, spicy, great ingredients, a just the right amount of bite.  WE WILL BE BACK, gotta try it all! Only thing missing is hot tea.","2013-11-21","0","W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w","QevYjxVahffbvVM53g9a0w"

So annoying they didn't care that under there elbow were people tring to eat. Food was good and we were told to ask for the manager Next time. Of course they think that next time we come we want to relive our story again to get a $5 ""I'm sorry""  not likely.","2013-10-09","0","wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw","QD2JToF9c49BwpYNncaiVA"

All excited to introduce friends to this place and I found the stench of cigarette smoke inside that I first assumed was from neighboring clubs.  The sandwich was sub par...dry and overcooked.  When I went for a drink I realized the staff including the cook was smoking.  As I left I registered my complaint and the manager just said ""nah"" and walked away.

"Great place to go! The wait time has drastically decreased since the other locations have opened. Having visited 3\/4 locations, Lakewood by far has the most friendly, personable staff. Bartenders are very friendly and attentive. The building is small and cozy, so definitely stick to a small party. Don't expect a table if you show up with 7 or more people.","2013-07-13","0","JFaTPxWQC14VmFnXLv7W1g","8BNibHcBaKsjYy3hTmqK5w"
"We've been here several times and have built a solid feeling for the place. The food portions are HUGE, and is generally really tasty! Wait staff is hit or miss. We've had birth very friendly staff and the absolute worst staff you could imagine. 
Being a beer snob, I have to day their beers are fantastic! They have a very wide variety of styles to suit all drinkers. 
One negative is they can be VERY expensive! Both beers and food seems to be overpriced in my eyes.","2013-07-13","0","CuT2Xh3vAYvRfxUWlUo6oA","8BNibHcBaKsjYy3hTmqK5w"

There should be free wifi like all other hotels in the area. The Blake is still a work in progress and hope to see more upgrades. The elevators were old and got us stuck a few times which needs addressed ASAP. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

"I've always been a fan of Guidos.. However today I was told that they hadn't planned on opening the beer garden until Wed but put a few tables outside anyway.. They told me that they couldn't seat any more outside because they didn't have the staff to cover the area.. I would understand that IF the inside of the restaurant was full.. But there wasn't a soul in the restaurant and about 10 tables outside. They just lost several drinks and 3 entrees of business! Not a great customer service moment!","2013-04-07","0","F1qPjasn0R6-j8sa6iYNmA","5RbsnIUYTxTBzPwjo_VC4w"

"$20\/hr for a foot massage. Great price for tired legs after walking on strip all day. A bit of a wait until you get the massage. But it appears to be worth it.

They start the massage with a warm water foot soak. The bucket is lined with a garbage bag which makes me believe its sanitary.","2013-05-28","0","f6CTsNX30XmC8siHWYV2bA","ZiwwZN6jO2S6TWA2EszLfQ"

Crab legs where pretty dry,  the pasta section doesn't even call your name..steak and mashed potatoes where good. I had guacamole with chips which where ok as well.

"If you are not eating or riding rides but bringing your children you are still paying 10 for admission. I chose to pay for Admission\/buffet. All the tables were reserved so we paid for our children to have fun and 20 for two adults to stand around. We paid 14.99 per child on top of the entrance and buffet fee for ride passes. Since they just keep letting people in & charging them to stand around there were no rides available either. 60.00 total for no food, no rides and no fun. 2 adults, 2 kids.","2014-03-01","0","v9EqcuA6eUvriLRwxbxQNw","5EQ0il4xKnCU6O_YF_R03A"

"Ordered a $30 pizza order. 2 pizzas with breadsticks. Neither of the pizzas had sauce on them. Breadsticks didn't even come with marinara sauce. So the whole order was without marinara sauce. We ended up warming up some spaghetti sauce. Called the manager and she said she would credit the whole order back to us. Called the next day. Only half of the order was credited back and the male manager I spoke with was rude. Inconsiderate and just disrespectful. I hope this store gets closed down.","2017-08-08","0","X5ywqgzCL9FvKRNSrBd4YA","eFZhVRtRcNxkj1T-kXXCSQ"

"We found this place through a ""Best Pizza across America"" on Google. It smells delicious the moment you walk in. The pizza is wood fired & very traditional Italian in flavour. We had the Diavalo & were pleasantly surprised by the level of spiciness. The Antipasto platter wasn't quite what we were anticipating, but it was refreshingly different & authentic. We didn't have room for desert, but next time we'll know what's coming & save room - very excited to try HouseMade Tiramisu & Gelato!","2013-11-06","0","7tNY4BYLA4laqWNV4IWGQg","2mXmWx-iSYdYEpm9oMB8CA"

When asked why, the general manger became very rude and claimed that it didn't matter that they pulled my carpet up. I asked them to stretch my carpet back into place and leave. When I showed up at my home 15 minutes later no one was there, it appeared no one had been there.  It was a scam to replace my carpet pad for an extra $300.

Service has its ups and downs (seems there's high turn-over, so a lot of times you're dealing with a newbie). My favorites are the pizza - can't go wrong there. Truly authentic NY pizza! Nothing like it around. I also love the Shrimp Parmesan and the Penne allá Vodka with Chicken.","2016-12-09","0","uTBm1BXwhdUcLJy2-IIQTA","5b6GlqmalYKacPBxDiBxYQ"

This place gets better and better.


Texas dry run on the ribs.  You can taste the spicy from the run below the bbq sauce.  
Pullen pork is tender.  

And I am in love with the brisket.     Seriously is so good it's not right.","2015-01-29","0","dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA","Iw3Fi7wFhmy39CwbiW5GLA"

"Great home made style Mexican food.  Mexican comfort food.  My family and I have eaten there for 17 years!  I KNOW Mexican food having lived for years near the border and worked from time to time in Mexico.  With the exception of their use of American made rather than authentic Mexican made cheeses (which many Americans wouldn't like), this is the real thing.  Prices are reasonable and service is faultless.","2014-03-16","0","y3RlbCN0UrDdLnjSF9NkXA","FcRr_F8KV_FwgASSPy2ilg"

"I had a groupon for a 90min deep tissue massage here.
Shaconya, my massage therapist was AMAZING. Very professional & I felt safe relaxing with her. Her touch was perfectly in-tune w\/ what my muscles needed to relax. Great start for the weekend! She didn't ask for a tip, but she deserved one. Give her $10-$20. ALWAYS tip your LMT ppl.

As for the atmosphere of the spa- the walls are thin & you can hear stuff going on in the hallway clearly. 
But I was too zen to be bothered. I feel so great!","2013-06-07","0","Yqrahz7JPKMoZUTE4LOINg","VHhEysRVEdx3Jl1WzAdpzQ"

"AVOID- Appalling...We went on a Sunday afternoon, after 5 fun hrs at the science center & the kids wanted pizza, & were told we couldn't order a whole pizza. ""Because only the owner can make them & he isn't here"" so we were forced to order by the slice. Then to make matters worse I watched the young woman behind the counter touch her hair & then a piece of pizza. The icing on the cake? The food was reminiscent of something I ate in the elementary school cafeteria. NEVER. EVER. AGAIN.","2014-03-03","0","4NpySSkznGaRVye30Pvdzg","88ZUOQunsIHjJNnKbpPLjQ"

The food was very bland and a weird texture. The rice tasted like it was made in a rice maker the day before and was very mushy. The naan was hard and lacked in garlic flavor.

Update: 2014-July-13: 
I posted this picture months ago. I love how that several people have contacted me to say that they had a similar experience as I had.

The management, nor the social media director for the Red Rock has yet to contact me. This tells me that they have no concern for customers on Yelp, or on Twitter, or on Facebook.","2014-03-22","0","RhEvP5flF6KoPriMHmVYGg","Ybc8ytcSZrNZ1x3Widy2cg"

However, I was really disappointed because I was seated in the back on the right and I saw only the houses, NOT the strips views as advertised. The helicopter flew like a circle, so people who sit in the front and the back only left side saw the strip view.

"Don't order your sandwiches through the online app. You will only get meat and cheese. Multiples trips in person to tell them to fix their online menu. Hey act likes it's impossible and it's they have to get permission from Eat24 to change their menu (so there is zero user interface from the restaurant on these sites? Really?)

"I love that this place is close to my house. I've been going to the same nail salon for five years so it took a lot for me to switch. I got a full set for 35. It was just acrylic regular but I brought my own matte nail polish in and they painted a design on top that took all of about 2 minutes. So I don't know why I got charged 35 when the normal price starts at 25. Overall I enjoyed my experience. I didn't have to wait long all though they were busy.

"I've stayed here on a few occasions in the past. It's 20 minutes from NW Las Vegas and a beautiful drive if you do it during the day. 
The hotel from the street view is beautiful. From a balcony room you have wonderful views. It's rustic and comfortable. Rooms are basic but the bed is comfortable. The bar downstairs is nice and the restaurant is pretty, food is decent. Aside from the front desk attendant being angry with life - this hotel is just right.","2017-03-08","0","ujVvI7_HZPUKagnBddPHPA","hXhYyN9GJ9pn4DZ03RTxIg"

"Breakfast burritos (the only menu item  I have had) are really good.  But, seriously, the salsa I could drink.  No joke.  I really think it's THE reason I keep returning.  Then again, salsa either makes or breaks the deal for me.

Pros: extremely clean restaurant, salsa is worth the drive alone, food is always piping hot, full of flavor, and well seasoned 


Cons: there is usually a decent wait, staff is lukewarm at best","2017-01-26","0","9Bg2JLQdyf97KlNuRQ56HA","_UbbwBeZ6shU3Z4R_C2vGw"

There were also a few details that were missing on the customer service front. The cashier didn't tell me how much the total order was when I was done ordering, didn't ask if I wanted a drink, etc. I know this is a fast food place but come on.

OK the meal is finished. There was a glimmer of hope from the nice young man that seated us but that was soon dashed by the unfriendly waitress.
