"When I came in there were two people waiting in line at checkout. Took me some minutes finding stuff I was looking for and when I got to checkout the two guys were still in line and had been joined by two more. No one was at any of the registers for at least ten minutes. Some employees were at the back talking in rapid Spanish though. Extremely poor service.

"Étouffée is AMAZING. Get the ""quad"", which is not on the menu, but goes beyond the trio of chix, crawfish and shrimp, by adding andouille. Very good roux base and flavorful heat that will take a few bites to fully develop.

"My favorite ""Italy"" spot for authentic groceries, prepared foods, pastries, and deli. Meet the owners Johnny and Heather who will take you on ""the tour"" and share some of the family history.

"Great airport, free wifi, decent places to eat and shop and clean bathrooms. Security lines are usually quite light (compared to JFK, Dallas, etc) And the concourse I was at, Concourse C, has free charging stations that accept USB...but no stools. It's a standup station. Overall, one of my faves.","2012-11-05","0","yQab5dxZzgBLTEHCw9V7_w","flROXbLTEO1z6eh8sETC8w"

"The BBQ fried chicken was probably the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. Juicy but not greasy, full of flavor, all around delicious. Four of us ordered individual meals, which is a ton of food, and the only thing that didn't get eaten was about 5 french fries. Highly recommend trying out this Charlotte restaurant icon.","2016-11-13","0","ghKN6NeyIBn9xxS0fO7SQQ","n1gFvPlfaFgw0vdDjyiMaw"

I asked him to name the ones that were available. He said ""we have chocolate"" He then stated ""I'm sorry, we don't have pumpkin or chocolate."".....huh? I told him ""Just give me the coffee.""

I had to call 4 times for my water heater to be fixed I had no hot water in my apartment upon moving in and for two months renting there.

 Then comes the small bites which the waiter described as similar to tapas bi ordered the braised pork. The pork melts in your mouth! It was very tasty. The pork was soaked in a ginger type sauce. It was good but I have to say that I have had some better pork belly.","2014-11-14","0","-sUf12Imjs68dBrmELiwzQ","EKN4CBp5b7vt-5SALOacVw"

"My first time at this place and considering it was a thai restaurant, I ordered a beef pad thai. Before I approached the restaurant, I was reading other yelp reviews and came across a few negative reviews, claiming that the pad thai tasted like watered down ketchup. However, I ordered it anyways because I was feeling optimistic. When the dish arrived, it was red, I thought this was very odd considering most pad thai that I've seen is brown. I gave it a try and I was really disappointed.","2016-07-01","0","hSKL-eAU_9rEyA3qmm8l-Q","WeuCGlMHDA8EKB6Uo2O-vw"

"Unfortunately this is the closest Michaels to me. While the cashiers are typically quite friendly the store is smaller and doesn't offer the greatest selection.

I then had 2 warrants for my arrest because he failed to show up in court. I got arrested and had to post bail. He claimed he went to court for me but obviously of he did I would not have gotten arrested. I paid him and now that I am trying to get my money back I can't get up with him and he won't return my calls. Beware!","2013-04-03","0","eHKD9ntS3lAlRREKrNDNZw","50FAIrjUTHASz8yvuHPOfQ"

When we got home wings were over cooked and greasy. You could have lubed a Volkswagen! Pizza is mediocre. I've had better frozen.
Took wings back the next day barmaid asked to replace. I said why would I do that. She copped tude . Don't do it.","2017-05-25","0","yStT0Yen34nU5T0XZpmfnA","luHPUcxfSLqJzQTHLfqDlg"

"Ambiance was nice after I moved to a table far far away from the loud ass party last night. my filet was decent but surely not worth the 31.99 price tag. The vegetable appetizer could have been more substantial. The bread was great but I wasn't impressed with the entree or deserts. Glad we had groupon coupons to take some of the cost away. Nice night out but, I'll go somewhere else next time.","2013-11-19","0","Ra5fI9BEAuWWaLJSfkiCiQ","HTpvmPI5xrlCgUmDVsIocQ"

- Stick with the classics- wings, pizza, burgers. Don't order the dinner specials such as salmon or steak, you're sure to be disappointed.

"I took advantage of the outdoor seating on the covered deck which has views of the marina and lorain lighthouse. I started with lobster bisque which was quite creamy and unique in its whitish color.  Tried the Salmon BLT which was fantastic. I washed down the side of crispy fries with a Great Lakes dortmunder.   I would highly recommend all of the above, and look forward to going back soon.","2013-07-05","0","NsF54LE_cc0OhFGPVkwDJw","HtNh4CrODIEH6X9vCFGdcQ"

"Make sure Adam is not your waiter. Not only did we wait 50 minutes for our order to be taken, I had to get another waitress to take our order. Our hummus finally came and then our food when we were done eating our hummus. It would have been fine if they were busy, or if he didnt leave us sitting there for 50 minutes without saying anything or if he wasnt standing around, looking out the window and texting on his phone. Really!? Thankfully the girl was able to wait on six tables and help us too.","2013-05-19","0","U3-kxz7NWq4ix4bPmKKQ0w","mPfLvSeRYqdQxJQk5ANVUg"

Not impressed with the place. Ordered a calzone. Yes it was huge, yes it could have fed a small country. But the bottom was burned black! The sauce was watery and made everything a soggy mess.

Not only did our server refill our drinks without even asking. But the manager of the restaurant also stopped by a couple times to see if we were enjoying ourselves. Great to see people who care about the customer experience. The pizza itself was pretty good. The bill would have came to over 40$ but with 1\/2 half off we only paid 25$  I would come back.","2014-08-01","0","rPL1gw_0Afm8nOAfLW53MQ","OuBz16Pd6WAv5mw8QPeY8Q"

"The mechanic I had been going to for the last 2+ years shut down and I was looking for a new one. I called Heisley Tire because the battery on one of my cars died. They fit me into their schedule right away and had the car running that same day.

I also needed some work done on another car, so I dropped that off as I was picking up the other and they had it done by the next day.

Great service, reasonably priced, personable staff. I dealt with Dale and I really felt like I could trust him.","2013-10-24","0","5uzct-a-s_ovwS810JkqLw","EVEiFA52Cvn776uEB0tgTg"

He had two tails, 5 scallops, corn on cob, green beans and baked potato.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  This food was every bit as good as high end restaurants with $75 tails.

"The WORST ribs I have EVER eaton. COVERED in 1\/2"" of sauce- first sign of something wrong. They were so tough & fatty I couldn't get my knife thru the meat\/fat.    Ribs are to be slow cooked so the meat falls off. I couldn't even use a fork to pry the little bit of meat off the rib. Go to Bugaboo Creek for good ribs. This place is awful.

The moon's on the wane
Tarts mutter their dream hopes

Come schemers and dancers
Cherry delight

"Awesome tacos (and bowls don't forget), an impressive draft and bottle list, excellent margaritas in a multitude of flavors, chips and salsa, lots of whiskey, and weekday happy hour and late night deals make this spot one to frequent if you're hungry or thirsty. 

Only negative thing I can say is that it can be crowded at times and somewhat expensive if you're dining\/drinking during normal times.

"Service was outstanding. Happy hour menu always top notch. Against my better judgement I did not order stuffed mushrooms with the crab cakes as usual. I wanted to try the lobster roll. MISTAKE. Was a $ 17 tuna fish on a hot dog bun. Neither smelled nor tasted like lobster. Two pounds of homemade potato chips on the plate doesn't make them taste good. Service was extremely professional and pleasant,  drinks were outstanding and the bathrooms are so clean you can eat off the floor.","2017-06-29","0","nv1XdkWviHXO7N6mK8O1yg","KGfooJqJ8oTPsFCKeREgPA"

"Bought a prime rib roast here for Christmas a few years back, worst roast I ever had. It was tough and tasteless, no one would eat it. I have been cooking prime ribs for 30 years so I know what I am doing. Then when I compkained they had the nerve to offer me a $5 credit. After much complaining they gave me a complete credit. Most of their meats were just ok. Will not recommend.","2014-04-03","0","BFz9R_pXiohU8EPBeJEK3w","U9Jf-VH1IVsRQoXqQlIo7A"

"Loved the stuffed olives, shrimp brushetta, drinks and coffee. But my daughter and I had the spaghetti with clams, barely palatable. First we were told the clams were fairly large, they were tiny and tasteless. The onions, which were not mentioning in the description over powered the dish. The spaghetti was more like ramen noodles and the sauce was bland and very little of it. The staff was friendly and efficient.
