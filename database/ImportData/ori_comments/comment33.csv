"It's really hard to find a good Indian restaurant in North America, but this ladies and gentleman is a gem! What caught my eye is that they have a dish named 'Goat Amritsari' and if an Indian restaurant has a goat dish you know it's legit. So when i placed the first order with them I pigged out and ordered sooo much that my bill was a $100 and mind you this was only for my wife and I! The food was excellent and Earth Indian has become one of my go-to restaurants! A must try is the Prawn Balchao!","2013-04-15","0","JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg","7iPbsw-VQ-opYs6fbVwWGQ"

"Went in today for the first time. Office is clean, front desk staff are courteous. However, the clinical side is a bit fishy...dentist didn't even look\/assess my mouth for any abnormality. Hygienist pushing for deep cleaning costs over $700. Regular cleaning consists of flossing and waterpik, cleaning time lasted not more than 5 minutes. I suggests to just floss and brush your teeth and it will feel much cleaner. To assess for any oral cancer...

No refs around to assist in games and has the 3-4 people that where there walking around without a barrel plug on in the staging area. This field has really gone down the drain!!

It was too late to cook so we ordered two pizzas, if that's what you can call them. 40 minutes later we got our two flat as pancakes, burnt miniature pizzas. We would have been better off going to dominos pizza. We're Italian so we know our Italian food. This is the worst.

"When we saw that Mandy's won so many awards, we were excited. We tried the pizza first, not wanting the hot wings to taint our palette. When we saw those small mass marketed pepperoni slices curled up into tiny grease filled cups, we had a bad feeling. Our concerns were confirmed when we tasted it. Very pedestrian.
 The wings were large and meaty but the sauce, instead of covering the whole wing, was merely drizzled over a portion of the wing. We ordered our wings hot but they barely had a kick.","2014-05-26","0","Ve6bA_jf9A7EWKXeyWf7PA","pCUApgpQLmYwTEzT6FToFw"

"Epic fail in food. I built a burrito with shrimp, guac, pico, cheese, and cabbage (they forgot the cabbage); and a side of refried beans (they gave me black beans unfried). We got a large side of guac (they said 2 smalls would be better, but they only gave us one). A side of queso (containing a nickel sized burnt piece). Amanda got a shrimp taco salad (mostly beans and rice. Rice?) which had a very large avocado pit in it. The 2 bottled beers were quite good though.
Only $32","2013-07-06","0","DyOzNIeXUksPNLXYHnB-oQ","B4xj3R55lYlxuGt-LRQKWA"

Group of 3s imo is the cap. Great for sharing food and still able to sit comfortably in their meant to be 2 ppl tables. Anything above 3(we were a group of 4), be prepared to feel squished.

"The plus part of this place is that the food was delicious. Everything the waiter recommended was tasty. The only down fall to this LOCATION is the common sense of how the staff handles things. Our waiter was nice and friendly but not the brightest. My friend sitting next to me saw him dip his fingers in someone's boba drink to taste the flavor because he didn't know which flavor was what. Gross! Food was great but staff not so much :(","2013-08-18","0","7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA","0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ"

"This place is in the middle of nowhere. You can take an RTC bus or Duce bus for $8.00 all day pass to the strip and downtown. Goes all the way to Freemont street. Runs every 15 min until 12:30. Starts again at 8:00 for RTC. I believe Duce is 24hrs. Purchase the tickets at kiosk in terminal, credit or cash. They have restrooms open 24hrs but that's it after 8:00. I was there at 11:00 waiting for Megabus for 12:30 and kind of creepy late night. I didn't see any security.","2014-03-02","0","shU97uo3R01v0KLlDnPaCA","IEfx7o-rLerjG_LlWUhcwA"

"Came here for dinner one night, be sure to make a reservations as it gets really packed on a Saturday night. The oysters were very yummy, tasted fresh and were not too fishy. We order the crab cakes and scallops as appetizers and they were delicious! Our main meal was the assorted seafood platter and the Seabass, which both turned out very tasty. The seabass was a tad over cooked. Our server was very nice and helpful when deciding which oyster to choose.","2014-02-17","0","Mrqk1ydkvgKtlxrExCv6gQ","Cxqx07meHH3j_r303vhDpw"

My wife left this place a long time ago when they raised the prices and changed the menu. The owner brought in new management who is trying to turn this place into Yama Sushi... Fail.

You are wrong. You can order 20 wings and get each 5 in a different sauce.  The only time they won't split the flavors per order is when they are on special 20\/$10 and that's very understandable.

"The Internet connection is so slow. I could barely check e-mail. The televisions are inconveniently placed in the family suites. The beds are stiff and the water in the sink and shower smell and tastes severely of bleach. The walls are so thin just having a conversation in normal tones in our room brought a noise complaint. The bar closes way too early although the bartender Valerie was a charming woman, very skilled at mixing drinks.

"My family decided to try Pisces Sushi Restaurant based on the ""excellent"" reviews. The restaurant has a decent atmosphere, nothing extravagant. The service was very prompt. However, the sushi was horrible. Considering that my husband and I are sushi conissures, this place lacks quality. The salmon and various meats are NOT fresh, compared to other restaurants that we have visited in other cities. Needless to say, we will NEVER patron this restaurant again! Definitely not worth the price!!!!!","2016-01-09","0","buacGSEw8yLGJo8g-i02wg","vEDs1M7-E3LZSMzcFHEEww"

"Good theater with nice reclining seats. 
You should have a good time watching a movie here. As long as you're not one of the people that pick the wrong theater when ordering tickets online and expect a kid working as a usher to handle it for you.Or complain about having asthma and having to walk past a casino with people smoking. 
If you want to be comfortable while watching a movie this will do just fine! 
Even the recreational offended can't complain about the seats, screen and cleanliness.","2017-05-20","0","p4JsD_Ya0NRXNdnhbVBs0A","egqAPQy6-PQvifCdf6Nlhg"

"Went there to redeem my Wagjag $12 half price voucher. Beef and porky jerky taste fine. But got push to purchase lot more than I wanted to by the guy with glasses at cashier who looks like the owner. Even after I protested I don't wish to purchase more than my $12 voucher, still have to pay over $9 on one order. While I still have 2 more voucher to spend.

If you would like to have it a little less filling, simply ask them to put less rice in it, then you won't feel like you just ate a whole cow and won't be able to move for the rest of the day.  May I also suggest trying the mango salsa on a shrimp borrito, it's really good!!!!","2013-11-20","0","EJmiKQKlWfY-0iVlya7FOQ","jP4etd3oMpVfmwXQVfsW_w"

The pork dumplings were clearly from scratch, and they were good. I ordered the spicy beef. It wasn't very spice but the ingredients were quality.

Another great amenity is it is located next to the Pittman-Wash Trail & Legacy Park around the corner on Pecos.

Das, was ""Maki Mix"" genannt wird, ist frittiertes Sushi von Vortag und war für mich ungenießbar. Das Buffet und das Running Sushi am Abend sind okay, aber mittags werde ich künftig einen großen Bogen um das Ginza machen. Ganz und gar nicht zu empfehlen.

"So today I ordered a 15pc sashimi and a order of Mongolian beef! When I got my sashimi I was shocked, what I got was three small pc of salmon and tuna the rest was eggs? Oh and of course imitation crab! I thought I ordered sashimi not eggs. My main meal was a huge flop it was suppose to be stir fry but what I got was a deep fried batter with dried out beef jerky it was disgusting! I could not even finish half before feeling really really sick. Final thought never go there it was horrid!","2013-05-14","0","eMTE-wqpk_YWaV3mf7Ii3A","Tn8NJEzZbbkHqJqr2VupMA"

"Mein Lieblingsitaliener bei uns in Ludwigsburg.
Guter Service, gleichbleibend gute Qualität.

Pizza: Dieser Klassiker schmeckte mir bisher hier immer. Knuspriger dünner Boden und gut und frisch belegt.
Pasta: egal ob Bolognese, Aglio olio oder ausgefallene Soße... nie enttäuscht worden.

Und neben den Klassikern gibt es immer eine saisonale Tages-\/Wochenkarte. Zur Zeit sind auch die Miesmuscheln top!

Ich gehe gerne hin und es war immer toll!","2016-11-13","0","DWJncfKA6vze7MaLilHV9w","GpdTEcAMtu1rH2QmEJ_J6A"

"Die Produkte sind wirklich top, angefangen von der Brezel über den Cappuccino bis hin zur Torte. Das Personal ist allerdings von top noch weit entfernt und zeichnet sich eher durch Arroganz als durch effizientes Arbeiten aus. Sehr schade, da die Produkte an sich die etwas höheren Preise rechtfertigen mögen, der Service jedoch absolut nicht.","2016-07-21","0","zp1ZI-1AS4wIV9VO3hLWtg","lxYcGdksQb1vuKJD-nhbaA"

We're big supporters of WWC and glad they are experimenting gastronomically with specialized events, but can you please go back to the old River's Edge menu for daily dining?  We used to drive out there all the time for dinner, but the new more 'fine dining' fare, if that's what you want to call it, isn't great, and frankly seems out of place in an outdoorsy\/more granola type setting.

"Tiffany (myself) has an on line booking site that makes it super easy to book an appointment and it goes right into my schedule! Sometimes I get a lot of texts from clients throughout the day and some texts get lost which causes some people to think its hard to book with 
me:( I appreciate my clients so much and want to make it simple for you!

No saffron flavor, dark coloring not yellow as saffron should be. The meat of the clams and mussels were the size of my pinky finger nail if not smaller, and  the shrimp were medium sized...It's hard enough finding decent seafood in AZ, so when u are paying $27 for a dish you expect the best...especially in Scottsdale.

"So it's my first time coming here, and I was a bit nervous at first because I was scared of getting my hair butchered again by a hair salon. But my manager recommended this place and the person that did my hair was Heather and she was super nice. 

She answered all my questions regarding my hair and I gotta say it was one of the best experience in a hair salon.

The past three times I've been back the tacos have had chewy nasty meat, or tacos with little to no meat and just other random weirdness.

Price seemed super reasonable and I fully trust these guys and Garage Doors 4 Less. I will use them in the future for any repairs or equipment, and refer my family and friends to them too!

The dessert was out of date, we didn't eat  the dessert. On the other hand, the tea was refreshing. Me and my friend thought that the food was not cooked today but from yesterday night. They just heat the food so that's the reason the food was not good because it was not fresh.

"Had to see what all the fuss was about. Well we were very much disappointed. Waited in line for 20mins+,ordered tacos alpastor, de asada & alpastor mula. The tacos are a 3 out of 10, lacking seasoning, the salsas are not spicy at all which we thought would give it the extra kick that they were missing but we were wrong. The tortilla was the only thing good about the tacos. We, coming from L.A. have to sayTacos El Gordo does not compare it self to the street tacos you find throughout L.A.

Better than canes or any other chicken place around.","2014-04-25","0","aqwn3jdQLCWnb59gHK4nAw","alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg"

A little overpriced for not enough food. $9,- for a burger, $11,- if you add the bacon, and a tiny salad? $10,- for mac n cheese? Maybe if the pasta was home made. And from what I tasted, the $3,- drink special usually tastes like Nail polish & toilet water.","2013-08-11","0","cz5vz-893D3LNH3TMQYR1w","mkzZH0GNvxgU8E7dF9w_IA"

"One of the best carne asada burritos that I have had. I was a little hesitant to try it out at first because of their location but hey! we really can't judge a book by its cover! It's a good price too! $7 for a burrito the size of an infant? Totally worth it.

"Visited a few weeks ago with my two kids.  My son ordered a kid's pizza for $10, he thought it was great.  I had the chicken panini with fries for $16 which I shared with my daughter. Panini was okay, but the fries were awesome!  I was very disappointed with the drink prices.  Ice teas were $6 each with no refills as they are considered mocktails... really?  No cheaper options for kids which I think is ridiculous.  For this reason alone, I am giving a lower rating.","2017-07-15","0","2auigv5pF08RjJ8CL1dIVw","3z-xQ5UCRwOlGdwnNBU2GA"

"Customer service via telephone DOES NOT exist. No one will EVER answer at any given Las Vegas location. You can speak to a rep who takes calls for all locations by pressing ""0"" once you're in the holding queue, but if you're unfortunate enough to get someone named Chad on the line, he won't IM or try to get a hold of someone at the store you're trying to reach.

The bugs baked into my car in the 100+ degree heat for a few days before I made it over to the pit stop. The guy actually used a hand sponge to wipe the car down before the regular routine.

"If you are from a place that does not allow smoking in public places then DO NOT GO HERE. Smells so smokey. It's gross. The food was so-so. Portion size is a plus. I went because you get a 15% discount if you are staying at the Holiday Inn Express next door. Wish I had gone somewhere else.","2015-07-28","0","X11JfeIVH9d6qMrDqA-N7A","cvQj_GnYZ3u8sO266qybLw"

My sandwich was made to order quickly and politely. And the items were fresh and tasty. 

I do agree with the others that said this place is too expensive. $11 for a BLT sandwich and a small fountain drink.

It's just okay but why was there chicken in it? Coconut ice cream for dessert made in house two thumbs up. So satisfying for a meal out. Small place, clean, nice tables, nice atmosphere.

"Customer service is terrible, if you ever decide to move you are pretty much locked into that contract even when LVAC doesn't have a gym outside of Las Vegas. Again customer service is the worst, there are far better gyms in Las Vegas that are cheaper. Gyms where you don't have to wait to get on a machine or use equipment. Gyms where you can go to the gym and actually workout, relax, relieve stress without the distraction of every single person taking a video of their workout.","2016-03-04","0","QireHpuod14zMB_8vYn5Jg","jr4B3Ub5acRsKgnB9xHBpw"

I had to go 3 different treadmills to find one that was somewhat clean. Equipment is very dirty. I did not even want to do floor work for abs because of how black the mats were.

"Worst restaurant ever. Their service is the worst Vietnamese restaurant in Junction, possibly Toronto. How the hell could you imagine there were only two servers in that fully packed restaurant!. I gave 5$ tips to the boy but he could not get it

Tips: never leave tips there because servers do not actually get it. They are students so Hannah takes advantage of them. Worst story ever heard. The food is cheap but partly I can figure out how quality those foods are! Especially their meats","2014-11-16","0","TRG1rwkydMzRIlGbhHEwzA","1lp0XLzd7AB1xReCz2Txxw"

I have eaten here on numerous occasions, both late night and for brunch. Though it seems the service has been put last on the list.  45+ minutes for two eggs and grits on a sunday at 2pm is inconceivable with over 10 people on wait staff, and I ended up taking my order to go which had not a single thing I ordered correct, and no utensils or napkins.","2013-04-28","0","9dqdzRzjSfbnMvjUGqWBAw","u-iPzwyP4p6rEoFVKrefxA"

God, I need to go back!!! Definitely a place you'll remember how good the desserts are!","2014-05-27","0","lHgr2wxDiOcEt3n40BcKmg","OJwIW7UKTOwvST9DFmeaZw"
"Usually, I get delivery from here but I decided to call in for a pickup order on a weekend night. When I got there, some drunk jerks were trying to talk to me and the waitress was too busy talking to her ""boy friend"" to even look at me. I literally stood there for 5 uncomfortable minutes with these drunks around me while this girl sat and talked right in front of my face.

"Went to this bakery on a whim because I have been wanting to try macaroons. I bought six which were: hazelnut, caramel, strawberry, chocolate PB, chocolate, and red velvet. The chocolate and red velvet were my favorite. My little brother loved them too! My boyfriend got a chocolate eclair which he loved. They were all very delicious.

"This hair salon isn't worth coming to unless you go to Susie. I was a first time client and soon walking through the doors I felt like I was being drilled by 2 women that worked there. I was very hesitant to actually get my hair cut and styles here until I talked to susie. She is amazing, I loveher. She is very down to earth and made me at home in her chair. She did an amazing job. I will deffinatly be coming back to see her!!! Thank you Susie!!!","2013-04-13","0","Ai9zZoFga2LtZhHobpl7RQ","fpV8kVlJQ-EmpboaWA9GJA"

I  go there because it is close to where I live. But I would NOT go out of my way to go there.

The reason I'm really writing is to tell the world that everyone needs to add red velvet pancakes to their bucket list! Don't trust other bad reviews. They are by NO means too sweet! Infact they are very mind...perfect id say! The cream cheese sauce even comes on the sie so u can add to your liking!","2013-04-28","0","vl2IZrNJEA8npSjqXbdwxw","JsbdV8dxqEGP5ssb9_QwDg"

It tastes good but it's not technically healthy unless you think splenda is your idea of healthy. Great wine selection and dessert is awesome. For what I consider healthy and put in my body, this would not be it, but it does taste good.","2013-10-02","0","DMyoxEaTGTakZxWgh1D5bw","H7eUleAgCAcbVDVRGI97BA"

"I'm not a critic, I felt the need to create an account just to warn off visitors.

Worst service and food I have experienced in Phoenix in over 10 years!
Cold 
Over priced
Rude
Was told "" well does it really look like a place to eat""
Just, Wow! Wow!

"Yes I grew up in the area and my best memories were cross country skiing in the park for gym class& sledding with my friends. During the summer we would bike all of the Cleveland Heights parks and go over to Ski Hill and ride down the hill. I must admit many a bike were ruined and of course we never told our parents how it happened. I moved back to Cleveland Heights when our kids were 4 yo and 7 yo. They have great friends and adventures. I even took them sledding to ski hill our 1st winter here","2017-09-04","0","ZHSxeoFoFaKI4rKp2ZwBjw","ESLPNSXmYOF4CSxFN7ZDxg"

The blonde still showed through and new colour didn't take to parts of my hair. she only noticed after my hair was dry. So she recoloured. After all that the colour still didn't fully take. She gave me the most scruffy looking cut and 4.5 hours later had the nerve to charge me up the ying yang for it. Disappointed.

"This was a far trek but well worth it! I always say if the bread in the beginning is good, then the whole meal should be amazing. The pot of bread lived up to its hype and I would recommend definitely choosing that over the biscuits and toast.

They were literally walking out the door without taking the things out between our toes. We were read to walk out and just not pay.

"Saw the cook drop egg spatula, pick it up and keep cooking with it, also picked through their cooked broccoli and carrots with their bare hands to put them in baggies. There are several things but one of the worst was when the egg mixtures for French toast, and scrambled eggs sitting in their stand underneath where the kitchen workers were pulling down ceiling tiles and dirt and chunks of dust were falling into the egg mixtures. Beware and eat at your own risk. Couldn't work there..yuck","2016-02-13","0","bVqNtwcwIz2gAacHWYF2lw","HjJj-nHIL-f0j42y4hilng"

The prices are very comparable to other stores that carry the same high-quality products and services.  My dogs love their spa experiences with the new owner, Becci at Kosmos!  If you aren't in that area, it is worth the drive.

I did ask for a new one, and they came back with a SLIGHTLY less cooked one. The service was great, ill give them that. But if you like your burger cooked the way you like the first time, you need to be VERY clear. Overall the bar itself is nice, but nothing special.

"This place is awful. They completely try to swindle you. The sales reps could answer none of our questions about the car and the warranties they push on you cover nothing.

"So imagine our surprise when the replacement for a covered road hazard still cost me sixty bucks because they only cover $125 for a tire!

"The tip is to AVOID this place like no other. There is no follow through from day 1 - deposit being returned. They have a high turnover of leasing agents so good luck dealing with the same person consistently. And apparently Ali's phone doesn't make outgoing phone calls. You are supposed to get your deposit back within 14 days but I'm at 25 days right now and still can't get an answer. Seems to me they consistently dodge people, lie and delay in returning your money.","2017-01-06","1","xBIG_S0i6DuioEvPM2kxMg","JkZhkcLnJS6-9vxTUKTcIQ"

"1st off having to see a urologist is never a fun experience. I had flank pain and my family doc had some tests done that showed a marble sized kidney stone. I made an appt and got in soon. I explained that I had a stone. I was told that the large stone was not really a stone but a ""blip."" He ordered more tests. My next appt he says you are fine nothing was on the scan. BUT I had a copy of the test showing 4 stones on top of the marble in my kidney. So I gave him the test and he said oops! Wow!","2016-06-01","0","ZrSsBKxSNjtZPtpRoSf-Og","agPI-m2hMObYObnXrbbZ0A"

"Came on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Very disappointing this time around. I used to be a huge fan of their separate dishes and especially of their Mac n cheese dishes. They removed them completely and instead put in a Mac n cheese bar. Sounds good, right? It's so much worse than their pre-made Mac. The only thing I enjoyed tonight was the 5 spice pork belly. Very lacking in the veggies and no sausages whatsoever. Only this ""homemade"" sausage, which wasn't even. Very disappointed.","2013-11-30","0","K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg","JAk9ZsDAzZo5FMfEgqj9ZQ"

"If you go during their peak times (around 12 or 1) they'll usually give you less as they're going super fast and trying to keep the line moving while also rationing the food. SO, you should try going when it's super slow as they'll give you bigger portions (especially if it's close to closing time)

I've read through some of the older bad reviews. I eat here at least three times a month. I've never experienced anything other than fresh food and nice employees. Yes the place is styrofoam, paper, and plastic, but that is easily overlooked by quality and quantity.  If you're going for lunch, call ahead with your order. The wait line can be close to going out the door. Could all of the people be wrong?  Try it!","2016-04-03","0","7H8Q6aTMDZIYEmhxsZMYfQ","MxI3qPnYMkk7gT5_37SbrA"

"DO NOT TRUST!! I had been looking for a new dentist and this was the third place I visited in one week. I had received positive feedback about my teeth from every other place but modern family dentist. They claimed I need $1,400 worth of dental fixes. They also forced fluoride on me at the last minute which I realized is not a common practice for adults and not covered by my insurance which they knew but didn't give me an option. I would not trust this place.","2013-03-25","0","ywdoUyIHo2G7F_XTglGUmg","2DizJYgqwuItRUltN6FN4Q"

Great contrast of flavor with smoked salmon, sweet corn, Israeli couscous, and arugula. I also had the scallops on their grits with bacon. Perfectly cooked. Melts in your mouth. The bread pudding was good, not great.  A little dry for my liking. Had a Manhattan to drink. Very good. But be warned, very strong.

Yes, we were also frustrated as we wanted our dogs trained. Tom did call us 2 weeks ago and explained the situation.  So tonight we had a training session with Tom for our dogs. It was a great session. We look forward to completing the training over the next several weeks to achieve the results Tom set out.","2015-09-04","0","rC7bKjfa5qH8iznBQ3G-8A","R0RP_7BBGXalB6P3iPHa3w"

We got the steam rice rolls and taiwanese chicken which really hit the spot. Followed it up with sweet seasame dumplings in coconut soup and grass jelly special..

602-391-0978. Both springs Installed $100. Precision Door will tell you their price depends on the size of your Springs. Not Spring King. Whatever size mine were, they had them right on their truck.

"How hard is a spicy tuna hand roll? I ordered that and a spicy salmon hand roll, both sucked. I had much better at my nearby grocery store. The ginger they served  came with a dead fruit fly, nice touch.

He examined leg, said problem may be shin splint from gait & type of shoes.

"@ Suzie S. This little Caesars location doesn't get a lot of business like other stores, so why would they keep 100 pizzas ready?? So they can waste product and eventually go out of business? Or maybe someone got the last Hot-n-ready before you walked in. REALLY??? ""It's not worth waiting for"" You're not going to find a cheaper pizza place in town for $5, also it only takes 7 minutes to cook a pizza, maybe a little longer for deep dish, other places take twice as long and more expensive.","2014-04-03","0","n-m449doCYEPAb5ux3dmVg","nIxxe02XO4ZcR9hT8OFQRQ"

The fish trio was well seasoned with the tuna making the best impression.  The fennel and rockets salad paired acid very well with the fish.   A lava cake for dessert with port and a latte left us with a complete experience.   The best attribute?   The service.  Outstanding wait staff and perfect delivery of each course.

"Convenient if you're staying at the airport Hyatt for a layover because you never have to leave the airport property. Or even walk outside for that matter.

"This place was terrible as far as hookah lounges go. 

Prices are pretty expensive, and their method ordering was complicated and ridiculous. 

Their food was okay, but they have a weird minimum drink thing going on. 

The tobacco they use isn't the best, they don't allow you to move coals on their own when they get harsh, and the hookahs took over 20 minutes to come out.

Rather than cook a new one they put the raw one back on grill, seared the edges and brought it back. They literally threw it on the table and quickly left table. After a bite, I saw it was still raw at center. I couldn't get anyone's attention and my guests were almost finished. Staff avoided checking with me again.

"Look...I'm not going to try to suggest that this is the very best sushi that I've ever had. But for a regular neighbourhood, I-feel-like-some-good-but-reasonable-sushi place, Nikko is tough to beat. Strengths: Spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls - really, really good. Miso soup - maybe the best I've ever had. Weaknesses: Shrimp rolls are a bit dry; sashimi is sometimes uneven. But honestly: If you live in the area, this is an absolute hidden gem. Value is unbeatable.","2014-09-21","0","rWSxR9jXz716Npg2TiRVcQ","gauk6SfTh7km3178SRSZ_w"

I get entry into clubs free cause I'm an Executive Host anyways but this dude bites.    Straight UGLY!","2013-12-29","0","0zeQRzpO06evIZfcR_aZ5w","eidw_iqx_5a1w3pYchm_4w"

"Best Vietnamese food in Toronto.
We've been coming here for a few years and it's consistently excellent. Favourite dishes: deep fried spring roll, cold shrimp spring roll. The pho is fantastic! (you can ask for it without the rice noodles) as is another favourite dish (basically rice noodles, choice of pork, chicken or beef, covered in vegetables, herbs like basil, and chopped chilies; the pork is the best).

I went in to get a full pink and white set put on. Within a week every bail lifted and two fell off. When I went back in, the technician used different colors on separate nails and didn't file down the pieces that had lifted, so they were still visible.

So my server was great and did the right thing by going to her manager who gave me a coupon for 5 yes countem 5 free wings. To be used that evening of another night. Very disappointed. The manager should have showed up at our table  and had the cost of the nachos covered. I would not have posted if I felt the situation was handled well.  Poor management and leadership. Food portions small for the price.","2013-12-16","0","_ug-QHzm2L4ANR9soBtdiw","2um5acwIeFJhlXc0jmZeGw"

"This place has a great vibe and fun atmosphere. The bartender Kyle was great and didn't look flustered once... but it was under staffed for the volume for happy hour. The owner - an older gentleman who wandered around the bar like a lost puppy never assisted the staff with anything. He stopped and talked to a few pretty girls while he ignored my credit card that was desperately sticking out of the check presenter for over a half an hour.

"Have been coming to DH for years now and it's been a favorite place of ours. 
That said, the original chef is gone, the staff has been downgraded to a diner type staff that would be unacceptable at Denny's.
The food is shockingly subpar these days. But I can always rely on excellent drinks from DH right? Even more shockingly, no.
The drinks are grossly inconsistent with zero value. 
It would usually be difficult to cut off a favorite from one experience but it's clear DH is in a downward spiral.","2014-09-15","0","hYX0z2C6Th5XmcrKOP31fQ","utVFFJQNROt1Jkz3eOGYiQ"

"All I ordered was a roasted ham and Swiss breakfast sandwich. When that took 10 minutes with no one else in line, I asked what the hold up was, it shouldn't take that long to heat up a sandwich. Turns out they charged me for something they didn't actually have, and then let me wait around 10 minutes for something that wasn't coming. Absolutely terrible experience.","2016-04-12","0","oVji4RtNNaGJU119CaCU1w","4sNBhoQ-4daVLdeLC3-t2g"

"Paul serviced us the first time and was a total scam artist. But after dealing with the company directly(Paul no longer with co.),  I would definitely recommend giving them a second chance. They had a service man come out the same day we called and was completely reasonably priced for what needed repaired. Having a car with car seats in AZ it was important to get service immediately.  Good service. Reasonable priced and efficient.  Deserves 2nd chance.","2014-05-24","0","X8GU6VrGJWsSVWZ1subCHw","Nwhmv1IRCkdoqDCA_9lEkQ"

"So, I rarely write reviews, because I am either always running late for something or I am just not that easily impressed I suppose. However, what gets my attention is consistency! When the food is consistently fresh, tastes good, and always better than you expect it or remember it, that is noteworthy. So, if you haven't checked this place out yet, then you're missing out.

"I have lived in the North York area for several years and discovered this place a couple of years back. Very tasty sandwiches except their ""special sauce"" tends to give me a really bad stomach ache every time the next morning. One of the owners is a complete jerk and gives priority to those of the same ethnicity (Persians). I have several Persian friends who stopped going there as a result. That said, try the Pizza sandwich as it is very good last I tried it.","2015-10-15","0","ugr3e-42ZVzaVnNWOH7JDg","wm12jgD-sOjzdGESprIRjg"

"I am a former barber that worked at Mens Lounge Barbershop.  The appearance, cleanliness, and beautiful counter tops and barber stations is what really sets this shop apart from the rest. Now to speak of the barbers. Each and every barber is very highly skilled from scissor to clipper to straight razor. They know what looks best on every head and face and are not shy in recommendations to the customer. Truly an amazing atmosphere and amazing haircuts. ANY barber in this shop will not disappoint.","2014-05-04","1","fq_Ys7lCS89-hRXBjKnBng","DCctANt2-Q-LV5OoWmpVag"

It means that the best Italian food in the world is in New York, aside from a handful of places in Italy. Asaaa forget about it.

Got here right at 8am and I'm still waiting
2 1\/2 hrs later .
I've asked 3 times  and repeatedly been told another 30 minutes. Only one Doctor taking patients . I tried calling the clinic ahead of time to ask what the wait times were and I was never able to get through. Now that I'm here I noticed the phones dont even ring through. The receptionists never answered a single call in the 2 1\/2 hrs I've been here. Calls just dead-end to an answering machine.

"The garlic butter pizza is amaaaaazing!!!!!  You're missing out if you don't try it!  I have never seen this type of pizza anywhere. The ingredients were fresh and the flavor perfect. We also had chicken wings which were perfectly toasted and crunchy. You have a choice of how spicy you want it. I got medium spicy and they were just right. I also tasted the BBQ sauce and that was also good. Difficult choices!  Yuri is very reasonably priced and he is a very entertaining and nice man.","2017-07-04","0","hkeHIe-JaUK5S5dUHgrBbA","AHc3PGThVtbw2kmZVqUv_g"

They even offered sauce samples to try-out before placing my order. The wings were great. The ""Hot & Sweet"" flavor was great. Good price standpoint. They charge by pound, not by pieces.

"Pork Fried Rice was ok, lack a bit of taste. Miso Ramen is about a 6\/10. Noodles a little hard. Broth was delicious. Service was great and friendly. Overall experience 7\/10.","2012-09-24","0","4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg","2OjtfJSXqz9rWUkbwqm-Eg"

"Crepes are made right where you can see them. They use real and fresh ingredients. Real food takes time so be prepared to wait but not too long. People  love real food so there may be a line and in that case be prepared to wait, but good food is worth waiting for!  #Mike is AWESOME!
