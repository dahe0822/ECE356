"Re:Food Court Meat and Soup combo at Hot Tofu. Go to Tofu Hut instead. 

Tofu Hut is known for cheap ayce kbbq. However, half of that small restaurant is for non ayce korean food, and the long lines aren't for that. 

One of their options is a soup meat combo. I believe it's almost the same price as the soup meat combos here except with better quality meat, better soup, and better sides.","2017-01-25","0","qVO3l9Q0-KVQE7W9JL9ePw","iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ"

I was just looking around one day when he and some other customers were going off on some kids for not being Christian, you could tell they were really uncomfortable. I'm glad he didn't drag me into that conversation. Last I circled this was a comic book store, not a church. I won't be returning either, seems like everything gets picked over by his box customers and were left with the scraps.","2013-12-25","0","K-VAzC7M63dP2JC5nwkxlA","0o2vwqrv_25Iy4frcSGB2Q"

Plus this place is so jammed packed full of stuff for someone like me who is disabled and visual impaired its very difficult to explore the place.  Plus the owner doesn't seem to get it.

"Place is great. 20$ for all you can eat dinner. Good special under new management. Didn't try the Korean BBQ but the sushi was bomb. I can smell the Korean BBQ!! Place is divided. Sushi from Korean BBQ all on all 4 stars","2014-08-02","0","pTJ8f4AfUW6uwKGdawLcfg","Z9O4lksocKqhDWP5mqzaHQ"
"Love this place! Its a must when you come to Vegas. All you can eat is priced right. Only thing i gotta say is once seated it can take up too 20min to receive your first roll no matter what u order. Its slow so order a gang to get em all at once Cuz it'll take a while to get your second order. Other than that dope place.","2014-04-12","0","ugLqbAvBdRDc-gS4hpslXw","Z9O4lksocKqhDWP5mqzaHQ"

They don't have room number direction so it was confusing!! The hallways smelled like weed, it was noisy and lastly they need to remodel this place or something!! I wanted to blow dry my hair, turned on the blow dryer... And it sparked!!! Shoot I got scared so we left asap. Will never come back here again...

"Beware!  I came in the store to get a gift card for my brother and law fire Xmas. The store manager rang me up. It turns out he tipped himself the whole sales transaction amount and never put the cash value on the gift card. It even says on the receipt, loud and clear, ""TIP FOR ELIE."" I wish I had read the receipt before I left that day, but I usually don't get stolen from by businesses so blatantly.

"They have a number of theme rooms which are fun. The rooms aren't huge, exceot for the Hollywood Room, which is VERY big. The cave room is tiny for $130 a night, but it does include a nice breakfast at the diner across the street. The cave room could use improvement, such as having a place to hang clothes. Yep, there is no closet, nor is there even a pole on which to hang clothes, so they obviously have no reason to provide hangers.  On the other hand, there IS a fridge and microwave.","2014-05-04","0","az5VAxfvkpXbUNtg-afSGQ","SOwvrRZr02IeR9ioT0iODw"
"I feel this store is the BEST bead store in NV. Their Swarovski crystals and pearls are THE most reasonably priced.  I tried to beat their prices at almost EVERY bead store in So. NV,  and several ""cheap"" on-line sites. Even when the others have sales,  they still cannot beat the prices here. There is a large selection of almost everything bead related.   They have FREE in-depth classes if as you purchase your supplies from them. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.

"PAGE 1 - They make the best,  and juciest chicken fingers ever.  Their fingers can be fried,  baked,  or grilled.   There are  9 sauces, + some specialty sauces that I don't know anything about.  The nine sauces are:  BBQ, Buffalo, Cheese, Honey Mustard, Ranch, Strip Sauce (House Sauce), Sweet Chili Sauce, Teriyaki, and Wasabi Cream.  They have a kids'' meal for $4.29.  It has two chicken fingers (strips), one side, and one sauce. Not sure about a drink.  MENU INFO FOLLOWS.","2014-02-24","2","wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw","SOwvrRZr02IeR9ioT0iODw"

"My newest most tastiest spot for seafood in town. The customer service was and is always courteous. They attend their guests and assist you very well. If you're looking for a taste of Mexican seafood try their delicious coctel de camaron or tostadas de ceviche. There are so many choices and options for every seafood lover out there, I recommend this place for anyone who wants to taste the best seafood place in Las Vegas.","2016-09-11","0","lF3klLu44Jaq3UqO9a50Pg","1IAuZhwpbGl8jwN2DTkh-w"

"They added a new item called boui-roast combo of pan roast and boiubais, I thought the pan roast was way better. You get more added seafood like clam and muscles but they were gritty meaning some sand in it. And the flavor was just not as good as a pan roast.

We had two different waitresses come to us checking our orders. Each time they got something wrong. One persons food didn't come out for 30 min. A roll was sent to the wrong table. When the check finally came they didn't even add up the total which was all nonsensical anyway.

Before I even take two steps in I am greeted with ""sorry but we are closed"". I was disappointed. Disappointed  that I made the drive out to this restaurant  just to be turn away. It's not even near closing time I arrived two hours before closing and I was turned away because they decided to do last call early and close down.

One of the servers was literally throwing the chopsticks, beer, even the dishes to the customers when she was supposed to SERVE them. Absolutely unprofessional.

The restaurant itself is very interest, kind of feels like a narrow hallway although it is so roomy.

"After a worth while wait to get a reservation, my boyfriend and I were happy to indulge at Giada. We left full and happy! The food met the standards of all the hype and the service highly exceeded our expectations! Thanks to our service, Joseph Brandon and Sione made us feel ""at home"" as Giada strives to do for all her guests . We look forward to returning for more and exploring the Fall menu.","2014-08-07","0","G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q","D1eEf6sRQ5LUesmroPUTEg"

"I bought 2 months of classes with a groupon. I love this studio! I have taken several different classes with different instructors and have enjoyed them all.
I really love Adria's Pilates classes. I try to do these at least twice a week. She comments on my progress and is aware of my limitations and helps motivate me. 
Even though it is not in my budget, she is the main reason I will sign a contract when my 2 months are up.","2014-01-24","0","l5WiFGlIKZUCTszTBxvCwQ","unHfodI3LNmIpLm1zke7ng"

"Jay, gave me the worst service, ever! He reached across a couple of our guests to serve drinks and when he finally got around to taking our dinner order, at his leisure. All of our drinks were empty, and that didn't seem to bother him either. And amidst him taking the time out of his busy schedule to take our order( with 3 other tables in the place), he proceeds to tap his hand on his crossed arms. One of our group mentioned that we must have pissed off the waiter.  Steaks, tough! That is all.","2014-03-24","0","hRQS8y-uG2kc8miWVYiLuQ","4qT5ND7LAwUcN-t6_P0yDg"

I didn't mind RAWs prices but a co-worker had just gotten the stomach surgery and was needing her fitness to catch up with her rapid weight loss. Nicks prices allowed me to convince my friend to pay a little more than her existing gym membership for a more disciplined routine!

"This was inside the food court of the Riviera. Its right off the Strip. The menu was dated... very old. I viewed the menu online but was disappointed that what I wanted was not available. My husband and I were looking forward to trying something different... not really satisfied. The food tasted okay. The establishment grade was an A but it looked messy.
