"Re:Food Court Meat and Soup combo at Hot Tofu. Go to Tofu Hut instead. 

Tofu Hut is known for cheap ayce kbbq. However, half of that small restaurant is for non ayce korean food, and the long lines aren't for that. 

One of their options is a soup meat combo. I believe it's almost the same price as the soup meat combos here except with better quality meat, better soup, and better sides.","2017-01-25","0","qVO3l9Q0-KVQE7W9JL9ePw","iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ"

"Place is cluttered and disorganized, kind of dark too. The owner is a strange fellow. I was just looking around one day when he and some other customers were going off on some kids for not being Christian, you could tell they were really uncomfortable. I'm glad he didn't drag me into that conversation. Last I circled this was a comic book store, not a church. I won't be returning either, seems like everything gets picked over by his box customers and were left with the scraps.","2013-12-25","0","K-VAzC7M63dP2JC5nwkxlA","0o2vwqrv_25Iy4frcSGB2Q"

Plus this place is so jammed packed full of stuff for someone like me who is disabled and visual impaired its very difficult to explore the place.  Plus the owner doesn't seem to get it.

They advertising discount combo price is completely confusing and you will have to pay more.

"We had reserve a king bed but when we arrived they gave us 2 twin beds. We arrived late around 11 pm check in was at 3 pm. So they have us our room number.. Couldn't even find it!!! They don't have room number direction so it was confusing!! The hallways smelled like weed, it was noisy and lastly they need to remodel this place or something!! I wanted to blow dry my hair, turned on the blow dryer... And it sparked!!! Shoot I got scared so we left asap. Will never come back here again...

"They have a number of theme rooms which are fun. The rooms aren't huge, exceot for the Hollywood Room, which is VERY big. The cave room is tiny for $130 a night, but it does include a nice breakfast at the diner across the street. The cave room could use improvement, such as having a place to hang clothes. Yep, there is no closet, nor is there even a pole on which to hang clothes, so they obviously have no reason to provide hangers.  On the other hand, there IS a fridge and microwave.","2014-05-04","0","az5VAxfvkpXbUNtg-afSGQ","SOwvrRZr02IeR9ioT0iODw"
"I feel this store is the BEST bead store in NV. Their Swarovski crystals and pearls are THE most reasonably priced.  I tried to beat their prices at almost EVERY bead store in So. NV,  and several ""cheap"" on-line sites. Even when the others have sales,  they still cannot beat the prices here. There is a large selection of almost everything bead related.   They have FREE in-depth classes if as you purchase your supplies from them. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.

"PAGE 1 - They make the best,  and juciest chicken fingers ever.  Their fingers can be fried,  baked,  or grilled.   There are  9 sauces, + some specialty sauces that I don't know anything about.  The nine sauces are:  BBQ, Buffalo, Cheese, Honey Mustard, Ranch, Strip Sauce (House Sauce), Sweet Chili Sauce, Teriyaki, and Wasabi Cream.  They have a kids'' meal for $4.29.  It has two chicken fingers (strips), one side, and one sauce. Not sure about a drink.  MENU INFO FOLLOWS.","2014-02-24","2","wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw","SOwvrRZr02IeR9ioT0iODw"

Nothing really looked appetizing and i went in starving! Regular stuff seemed over priced. Organic spinach at TJ priced less then the reg spinach there...

"Should of known better then to go to a Japanese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown in Las Vegas. Had the shoyu ramen, disappointing not authentic Japanese flavored broth. It had a slight sweetness to it.  Most Japanese ramen soup bases aren't sweet, but are salty.

We had two different waitresses come to us checking our orders. Each time they got something wrong. One persons food didn't come out for 30 min. A roll was sent to the wrong table. When the check finally came they didn't even add up the total which was all nonsensical anyway.

"I'm not sure if this is a practice regularly done by this restaurant however, my review is based on my first impression. Before I even take two steps in I am greeted with ""sorry but we are closed"". I was disappointed. Disappointed  that I made the drive out to this restaurant  just to be turn away. It's not even near closing time I arrived two hours before closing and I was turned away because they decided to do last call early and close down. Which by the way they still had guest eating inside.","2015-04-23","0","j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg","V14kFxyJbbiMXZvbdjYoew"

"About 9pm yesterday (7\/3), they were busy. There were only 3 servers. I don't mind if they don't take care of the customers for refills when they are busy, but omg, I couldn't believe my eyes. One of the servers was literally throwing the chopsticks, beer, even the dishes to the customers when she was supposed to SERVE them. Absolutely unprofessional. They should be able to figure who that was. That was the only server who's doing that.

The restaurant itself is very interest, kind of feels like a narrow hallway although it is so roomy.

Food server wasnt even checking if the food was ok or not.   i saw more of the busboy more than the food server.  i think the food server was guaranteed 18% tip and so he did not care if we were taken care of or not. once he served the food we did not see him till we got the bill. and was not even offered desserts. he served ice cream without spoons.","2014-01-31","0","Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw","-S0Zk7CL5xxVgiSoCESgLg"

When people come in dehydrated put an IV in them ASAP. Replace the Drs and nurses with rude attitudes that act like they don't like their jobs. Cause the bad ones out shines the good ones.

"Jay, gave me the worst service, ever! He reached across a couple of our guests to serve drinks and when he finally got around to taking our dinner order, at his leisure. All of our drinks were empty, and that didn't seem to bother him either. And amidst him taking the time out of his busy schedule to take our order( with 3 other tables in the place), he proceeds to tap his hand on his crossed arms. One of our group mentioned that we must have pissed off the waiter.  Steaks, tough! That is all.","2014-03-24","0","hRQS8y-uG2kc8miWVYiLuQ","4qT5ND7LAwUcN-t6_P0yDg"

"33 omelets to choose from! The omelets are made with 6 eggs each. Might be a good meal to share with someone you are with.  Each breakfast comes with your usual bread choices but also homemade, hot banana nut bread or a pumpkin spice bread! I am about to start my HUGE meal!!! I ordered ""The Californian"" sausage, cheese and avocados. The meal arrive and home made potato chips line my plate! Wish me luck.

I didn't mind RAWs prices but a co-worker had just gotten the stomach surgery and was needing her fitness to catch up with her rapid weight loss. Nicks prices allowed me to convince my friend to pay a little more than her existing gym membership for a more disciplined routine!

Get a taxi so much cheaper and faster and friendly.","2013-07-17","0","eStn1HCGNcKiLXc0pfvZxg","bPhqZ3A_SCp7Cx8pCjryAQ"

And if you pay something with your card and overdraft even by like a penny then deposit money right after at the atm they still charge for an overdraft fee. any other bank does not do that!!
