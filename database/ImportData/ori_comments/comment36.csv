Yelled at surfing the other end to tell her our order saying ""I can hear you from here"". I had questions about the HH deals but didn't want to shout.

"They lie about delivery time to everyone and it's shown on heir Instagram account. They do not have ready made denim at all. They still have to be made and your order will remain on queue like everyone else. Who knows how many weeks or months you'll wait.

"I live near by so I decided to try it 2 different times as a matter of fact. Wings were average nothing special. Most wing places would include veggies with your wings but I had to order veggies as a side and I got 2 carrots and 2 celery sticks--so not worth paying extra for. The service omg where to begin; it was slow. The waitress had a""still"" look; it didn't matter if your going or coming and does not seem happy to serve you, never attended to us after we got our food.

It is hard to find. Go to the Eaton Centre (corner of St Catherine and Rue McGill University), then go down to level 2.

"Love the food!!! As a side note...they use the 'village' method of assigning servers meaning no one has assigned sections or tables and if you look like you're ready to order or need anything, all servers are fair game! A little confusing for first time visitors if you think one person is your server and 3 others check to see if you are ready to order.

Make sure you check an hour or two before the scheduled time online to see if the class may have been cancelled (this happens if no one signs up). Have fun!

"I've had Uncle Maddio's delivered twice via GrubHub. The first time was a revelation. The pizza was so good, so intensely flavorful and perfectly prepared that we were like, whaaaat? No way. So we ordered a second time a few weeks later, with low expectations. We figured we'd be chasing that Uncle Maddio's high forever without catching it, you know? Wrong. Again, a fantastic pizza. The toppings are truly first-rate. The salads are great. And this review is based on delivery, remember.","2016-09-25","0","dRib7YK9Mtqgvfqsf-PKrw","n5WrquwVv3fo_IgDfyt5IA"

Its not worth the bad ratings when their food is so good. Whenever I called for delivery they would tell me how long & were always within range, even when its an hour and a half long.

I went with my sister while staying at South Point for a conference. She normally doesn't finish her plate, or box here, but she did. They gave us 6 or 7 dipping sauces and the garlic butter sauce for the steak was absolute fuego. Ordered a mixed 6 piece gyoza and received 9 pieces. We had prime rib, steak, grilled calamari, all 5 stars.","2015-09-14","0","w6zW6gIyg1sI5V6Wag_SYg","p5DTzMzIDyee3NKDYM7XsQ"

First off let me say I have NEVER had Portuguese food before but I was in my way home from a long hectic day and happened to catch this place out of the corner of my eye. Thought to myself, well I've never had Portuguese food but hey why not try it. From the second you open the door you feel calm and invited. Was greeted by a very professional young lady who explained the menu, which was great since I had ZERO clue.

"Just purchased a 2004 BMW 745LI on Sat Jan 31. I received the most amazing customer service from a sale rep by the name of Anthony Mario. He got me in the car I wanted at a very reasonable price. I had an issue with the car when I got it and they fixed asap. I took the car in at 9am and had it back by 3pm the same day!!!. They also put me in a real nice loaner car. So if  you are looking for a car and want stress free service. Go see Mario Anthony :-)","2015-02-04","0","M3Tnb8WfVP8aEfiFyUuuYg","MbSG3TwWOKgFLFEfpVuCfQ"

"We LOVED this place! The food selection on the lunch buffet was incredible and tasted amazing. We're pretty picky about our Indian food, and this place did not disappoint! They had some dishes new to us! Fav dish was the Chicken Tikka Masala. Flavors were nice & even. Some Indian buffets do not have much for a ""salad"" section, but here they did. Witnessed staff taking food temperature readings, which is a nice thing to see. It means they care about the customer. Very clean, & friendly staff.","2014-09-19","0","3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA","SI2ljxkOJVzCDOHcJRVDfA"

"Here's a tip: if you like your appetizers hot,  don't eat here.  The nachos have grated cheese, but they don't bother heating them up,  so it just stays in an awkward pile and falls off as you attempt to finagle a chip into your mouth.  Ditto with the artichoke dip. It's effing cold. But they're so nice they'll warm it up for you.  Haha","2016-10-15","0","uXZ4Of7CV77SmKIjya3y_A","WeHffRGwXVuqdQyOxsAg0Q"

Expect an average of a 10-15 minute hold EVERY time you call in.
That is not an exaggeration.

Also expect to schedule 3-4 weeks in advance.

Dr Sadek is professional but his staff and organization are seriously lacking. 

His PA, Sadie Mueller encouraged me to use the IMS app for communicating and scheduling rather than acknowledging the unprofessionalism of their office.

"I adopted a dog 3 weeks ago from them. My husband was away. He came home, a few days later had allergies. Later realized, not due to dog.
I  commented this to former foster mom of the dog. Said she would hold the dog a week or 2 until my husb. gets better. I inquired about my dog during that week. After 1 week, I wanted my doggie back, they said no. Foster mom gave me Diana's #, I texted her 2 times. She was extremely Rude. I took dog to vet. I was treated like a criminal.

I was informed that you all closed at 930pm but I didn't not expect to get warm sushi, old chicken, dried out bake bacon potatoes, and just over all LOW quality food!!! If your food is going to taste horrible and mostly be cold you should lower your prices after 8pm or just close early. I do not ever plan to come back and I've been a regular costumer for a couple years now!!! I paid over $25 for the worst meal I have ever eaten!!!","2016-07-14","0","ooFlFjIuGW8Lx0bxmvEZJg","MvVYBkDVAbJAQEmAMCz1DA"

"For all of you that gave the show only 3 stars.....puleeeeezz! I am a native of Nevada and Las Vegas is about evolution. LV has always been known for its over the top shows and even though I am also a Cirque fan, something different, something more worldly like Panda is a breath of fresh air. Chinese culture is a beautiful one and this show highlights some of the amazing arts from the East. Beyond martial arts and acrobatics, the background effects and music bring out common human emotions.","2014-02-08","0","xsyYEo7ujHtPFvneCPLUXg","YjmXrDJg8mx24TH55rldVQ"

"My wife and I have been going to Robyn at Suite for years. My wife loves Robyn's artistic and edgy hair styling.  My wife has had beautiful Ombre's for the last few years by Robyn.  She says her attention to the blending, color and cut are a step above anyone who has ever cut her hair in the past.  Every time my wife comes home she just loves the color and styles Robyn creates.  Besides the attention to detail Robyn is fun and easy to talk to and makes the time fly when ur sitting in her chair.","2016-10-19","0","3jJ836RF3OBFly_Ry9xojQ","iOIGR6HamkydAhgwamDArA"

"VIPS is among my favorite non-AYCE sushi restaurants, simply because their maki deliciousness is absolutely off the charts! Despite the small space we've never had an issue , the place is mostly take out so people don't stay in long (but you can). Ingredient substitutions are not a problem, I've been there with a non-seafood eater friend who loved the food. If you love to experiment with food, they have some unusual maki choices too.

If you're ordering a burger, you get a choice between tater tots or fries. I would go for the tater tots.

I would not go back and definitely not recommend then at all.  I have had better products from  Fry's bakery.","2017-01-30","0","M007_bAIM34x1yd138zhSQ","oIzNuwgq5IkXpzPTosIKUQ"

"Wow, what a disappointment. Was so fired up for the place. Horrible service. The only redeeming item was the food was actually really good though. Drinks were bad. The server had only worked 6 days and she was the only one working the bar, Reataurant and host.  Certainly don't go here if you have less than two hours for a dining experience. In the two hours we were there we were the only table that had people at it. That obviously tells you something.","2016-04-30","0","3-aEgS7X2jrbxA7sA1nARw","3hmEbLX7Ple8qs8BZLB4fw"

"Father's day fail. 

Overall taste is good. Good amount of smoke, mustard in pulled pork Carolina low country style, ribs savory and without the Texas Crutch. Don't tell me combo has 1\/2lb of pulled pork and give me 200g, or that you get a pint of collard greens and give me 300ml. Portions so small we used a measuring cup and scale to double check. Left silverskin on underside of ribs - very amateur. Buns day old stale. Left VM at 5pm - no callback to date.

"Tried the make your own salad - could be a better (more variety) salad bar with the veggies cut more cleanly (membranes & seeds in the red pepper, the ends of the romaine in the lettuce mix), but I am fussy like that & maybe others eat those parts. The chicken breast was flavorful. Had the free small plate with butternut squash which was very tasty. Nice folks too.","2014-07-09","0","6Cl15LapBVhw4ZfBIeVJJA","nARUugR9iCu3eh8jCBKlrg"

"For those of you returning vehicles: go into the self-park garage at the Bellagio. Head up the outside ramp to the third level (you'll see an Avis sign). Turn right to enter the garage at that point. Park the car and take the keys down to the main lobby area (Casino level). Go to where the valet people are, and you'll notice a grouping of stone sculptures. Behind there is a small Avis office.

Laura is an amazing therapist and human being. Her knowledge of how the body works and the various modalities she specializes in really helped unlock parts of me that I never knew even hurt.

"Decent spot, nothing really special. it has an extensive beer and liquor menu, but their ""specials"" aren't that special. $7 for a chicken sandwich? wow. I hung out in their tented area, which is kinda nice. it's warm and has lots of TVs so you can watch a bunch of sports. but the bartender has to run inside to get your drink orders which slows down the service a little. 

overall it's a nice place to watch a ball game, but there's better spots around the area to go.","2014-04-04","0","9oFUULQfMMrNJqFbX_2-Qg","vBzqc2YML1M3hUJiq0cjgg"

"We ordered take out because there was no seating available when we arrived. We ordered the Ruben, the eggs benedict and the pancakes. The pancakes are a hearty filling choice, a fluffy texture yet cinnamon taste. The reuben has a sort of co-mingling taste, everything in this sandwich works well together. The eggs Benedict will not be ordered again, I found the tofu too thick under the yolk of the egg, the tomato on the eggs benedict also provided a rather strange taste, there was no ham either.","2017-02-19","0","kywgPe0g6aVoq4VOMRMX1w","PyuwkgMhG87l8yimRfT41w"

Bring a cushion if you are sitting at the bar, stools are uncomfortable. Will give them another try for food as I found the wings bland, pizza crust seemed store bought and bone marrow undercooked.

"Finally good Italian food! They brought out three large fresh hot garlic knots that just melted in a symphony of buttery bread with savory garlic and amazing parmesan cheese. My husband and I shared an order of their hot wings, then he had the chicken parm while I had the Angel hair pasta in a basil tomato sauce! I couldn't resist their cheesecake and boy did it taste just like back home in NJ! We will be regulars for sure! About time Henderson had some quality restaurants!","2014-03-22","0","Bo8hpmBWPWHOv6cEEF7ueg","7jLEbMTtJznxw0b4Oy6WxQ"

She rushed through it and she had an attitude when I changed the setting on the massage chair and she decided to turn it off for she claimed it moved my foot somehow.

When I tried to share my concerns with a manager,  he said that the event started at 9, and it was stated in my ticket, however it was not!  The ticket had 7 pm with nothing else on it.","2016-11-18","0","BslEhCyzaQPfpHtDogb4hQ","JzuVVB3EpCR389-z_1gKYw"

"I hit a curb while driving and messed up 2 of my rims and tires. It was sent to service kings and sat there for about a week until 4 new tires and wheels got there. These were very expensive sets. You would think they would keep them secure at all times and not just laying out in their back yard. They were stolen. Apparently a ""tow truck"" came and someone saw them load up the tires and wheels. They called us about what happened THE NEXT DAY at noon. It happened the afternoon before.

"Have been twice, both times an amazing meal was had. First time my friend and I split an appetizer and main course between the two of us. The 2nd time we all split apps, had a main and desert (had to pack a doggy bag). Think the next time I go I would split a lot of Tapas at the table  instead of doing the traditional apps, main course and desert - so much to try. Loved the seared scallops, if you love fresh seafood this is the place to go.","2016-11-27","0","3fxpRLPjrSuuFmf3tCwNkg","msKtfMpkAQ61_lV0O3LBMQ"

"This is by far the best dry cleaning service we've ever had. If you come to Las Vegas look this place up. The owner is so friendly and accommodating. 

We were in desperate need of a cleaner since we miss the cut off time from our hotel. We searched thru yelp and found One Click Cleaners. We called and spoke with Matthew. Despite how late it was, he was able to do a rush service with an impeccable quality on dry cleaning our clothes. I highly recommend this place to any of my friends and family.","2014-11-06","0","oE7K-J2pksEGoKgfoBFcIw","a965GVzjDAcpunsit5R4uA"

You don't find many businesses that focus on supporting local food suppliers. The service and food were both excellent. Sometimes people can have bad days. If your visit here wasn't to your liking I'm sure that the owner would appreciate your feedback.","2017-08-14","0","9vE7zB60qhDw25IG0KUi7g","ayatzs_EgllPALJzSn5IPw"

"Everything I have tried at this restaurant has been really good so far :) Try Iskender if you are really hungry, it's delicious and very filling. Lahmacun was also very good. Now I am working on trying different items, if a place can pull off Iskender, I am sure they can also do great job at other items, too.  Most Turkish restaurants did not last too long around here, I hope this one lasts :)","2017-08-09","0","JUY-6k02E-Zf5QZXhnKabA","rrlAUd6v5k5skQxrHTbpdg"

Well I was completely disappointed the happy hour started at 3 we were there at 3:15 and we were handed the lounge menu which I though was the hh menu well it wasnt it was double the price. The smoked wings were so smoked and tasted like liquid smoke & dry!

"STAY AWAY!!!! This place sucks. The management is non-existent and if you can find one they allow their employees to trash the guests, and treat them like shit. SO IF YOU WANT TO BE HUMILIATED GO THERE. They take forever to NOT serve you, and you will just waste your time to find this out as you read other reviews posted here.

Reviews speak for themselves. If it suits you and your anatomy can support it, we can make your piercing idea happen. Look through ALL of the reviews. Yeah, some things are kind of expensive (check only non-5 star piercing review), we're an upscale shop that only works with the best jewelry around. 

And while you're at it, you can check out actual work by visiting either my own or the shops IG page (@kid_qik, @clubtattooscottsdale, respectively).","2016-05-29","0","aAGdfkiokvlq5VA9yzmn2g","R019TNdqlFtEqQgp8BQpmw"

"First and only tip, choose another restaurant!  Plenty of other cheaper and more authentic places within a quarter mile of this shit hole.  Menu looks awesome, but one taco per Oder if they even enter it for you.  The service is shit they act like they are doing you the favor of seating you, taking your order and bringing you food.  You should be grateful even if your food does not come.  This is the attitude at this restaurant.","2016-05-23","0","svdEhLmNmpVaIv1WLtoOvQ","cM_qpDXYQN6IwHQjtKVXvg"

The owner couple are so nice and cute. Foods are fantastic, so yummy. I love sides dishes coming along the main dish I order. They are so generous, and love to introduce K culture through K food. They serve other foods if it's not too busy, such as small portion of soup, fermented rice beverage after meal.

I like this place. Got a perfect haircut for a cheap price. Issue is I had to direct what to cut along the way; not as simple of telling him a style in the beginning and voila. The owners son cut my hair for me.

"Worst burger joint I have ever been to. Got the billy burger with fries and root beer. Whatever sauce was on the burger was 90% vinegar I think and soaked the bun. Asked for no tomato but got it anyways. The patty was paper thin, Fries were soft and gross. All for only $14. HA. Don't even waste your time going to see the decor.

"Hi everyone it's Angela,
 A few tips for a safe home! Bee season starts as early as late February thru October. During these times inspect your home on a regular basis for bee activity. Typical places to inspect would be eves of your home ,under or around sheds, valve boxes, along the bottom of home, and water spigots. Make sure to call with first signs of bee activity because with bee removal it's always best to solve the problem sooner than later and have a much larger problem.","2017-03-25","0","Mz8SxYTJaXKOjW60zWo-TA","jML_BW5epui-vHWHxbO9nQ"
"Don't drink the tap water. Splurge on the bottled water.

Three friends tried it and all agreed. Even had a chef with us who usually likes the fancy food and even she said it tasted burnt. Even worse they served cold french fries. How does a high end brasserie serve cold fries at lunch?  Especially when there is no crowd? The only bright side is the service was pleasant.","2014-06-01","0","d482l58ho0_IMdFkXX1F5Q","y_Z-HNlIwAt7b48Lq72snw"

"Service was very friendly and helpful.  For our starter we tried the pretzel board.  It was a nice starter with many different flavors.  For our main course we split the AZ burger and it was delicious.   The fries were thin cut and crispy with a rather basic ranch dressing.  We loved the salted caramel cake, truly unique. The restaurant has a very open and casual feel to it.   Will come back and recommend to others.","2014-08-04","0","bxRFIGAcYREvDBT3Nw3Vaw","lL9h5jkfyCJP8Fzrcejr6g"

There are cha-shu, boiled egg, kikurage, bean sprouts, green leaf and shredded baked egg(kinshi tamago) topping.  I tried Miso-Goma and I enjoyed sesame flavor. I will try Ponzu next time.

Poor planning but I assume this will be corrected by Giada as the staff and GM get the bugs out. Try it as a couple first to see how you like it. I will give it another try after another 6 months to give them another shot.","2015-06-25","0","G-5kEa6E6PD5fkBRuA7k9Q","hA-YifinbIGlJZWcgqGrOQ"

Also it comes with free hot stone and paraffin, I have to say the paraffin was feel great, it's warm and after that you will feel you get a new feet they are so soft and smoothly, it is good for especially dry skin.

"We've been here twice. The first was 5 stars and the second was 1 star. It is also a bit too pricey to have an one star experience. We are not sure we would want to go back after our last visit. The hotdog quality was not there. It was shriveled up and mushy. The toppings did not taste fresh. The fries didn't taste fully cooked and the toppings for the fries were lacking flavor. The condiments tasted watered down. The overall environment felt sticky and dirty. Costumer service was also lacking.","2016-09-04","0","k0Bj4ZYyoICz6Mhx2f9Udg","zdvp8UAbLhaefrwu0k3Uxg"

"Great food but was cheated. I watched him mix my drink with a less expensive bourbon than what was listed on the menu. Before the bill came, I asked him if they ran out of the bourbon that was supposed to be used & was told that it was indeed in stock. However, the bill was not adjusted accordingly. Makes me wonder how many times the same stunt has been pulled on others. To my mind, it's tantamount to stealing from your customers. I won't be going back, either alone or with friends.","2016-12-28","0","RyDiwx4xD3Lx8sWHx1aFlQ","1NI1Jd5z3yC3XR2wmnBYCQ"

"The food was really good. The mango lassi was particularly good.  It was all highly spiced (but not too spicy) which I enjoyed.  The butter chicken didn't have cream which I thought was odd but it was still very good. The only thing I didn't love was the samosa, and their mint chutney wasn't my favorite.  I loved the tikka masala, butter chicken, mango chutney, naan etc. highly recommend","2014-06-06","0","o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw","5vfft-cbad3nrfgHRoJekQ"

"I went Supercuts, 34190 Aurora Road, Solon, Ohio 44139, again today. Another awful and very disrespectful experience. I went in for a simple shampoo. The stylist named Sarah rudely informed me that the owner Julie all but asked me out of her salon. Sarah rudely informed me that the owner Julie called the salon upon my check in, and told Sarah to do my hair. I wanted the other stylist to do my hair. So I was also told by Sarah that the owner required me to leave by 5, with wet hair.","2016-04-17","0","YWSV2iJVXXDXel3tFxojZg","YtIJIT8PeUAYKzIwTvm7dA"

"We thought the variance on quality of food was very high. I thought my food (some kind of divorced eggs), was OK, but others thought their food was quite bad. They also screwed up a number of orders, despite the waiter confirming he got the order right when we placed it. Ordered (free with check-in) flan, and fried ice cream, and churro for dessert. They were pretty good.","2016-02-20","0","JDZ6_yycNQFTpUZzLIKHUg","OL4KvIB5oLOgCZZW7kh7EA"

She doesn't speak English, she doesnt listen obviously due to this.   She files and clips WAY to much, applies shellac in the worst possible way, in which it leaves bumps at edges of nail.  I have had black applied before with only two layers.  She did three.   Honestly my head felt like it would explode every single nail she painted.

"Love the foam. Delicious and sweet, adding a delicate touch to what is already a savory delight. The drinks however were missing a stronger aroma to the winter melon flavour presented. I added grass jelly and it provided the much needed texture to compliment the beverage. Chatime should be afraid of the competitive.

The summer corn, edamame, Korean beef tacos and Pad Thai are to die for. Chef Herb Wilson personally came to our table to make sure our meal was perfect. When you go in make sure you ask for Austin, he was the best server. He is very attentive and makes amazing recommendations based on what you like.

And the service is great. Karen, both partner & chef, came out at the end of my meal to greet me and check on the food. The drink I had was on par with that at velvet tango room. The only downside:open until 10. yelp says 11 but they close during weekdays at 10. Go check them out. You won't be disappointed.","2015-07-22","0","UAN1e9bhLqQZcgpsZwvHww","mQOm6FY9mj0uF-YEZwXK3g"

"This was my first and last time here.  At the end of the massage, they asked how much I was going to pay.  I responded $23, as the massage was not great and the masseuse did not provide quality service.  Their employees started bad mouthing me in chinese and an  employee immediately demanded $30 to be charged onto my card.  I responded, ""tips are optional and not required"".  Then they tried to negotiate the final price to be $25.

"I had my brunch reservation to celebrate my anniversary booked a month in advance. I was so excited to go to Cluny. Place is stunning and people were very nice. I wanted it to keep being awesome. Unfortunately I ordered the Maple Bourbon pancakes. I received 3 pancakes: 1 was burnt, 1 was raw, and thank god 1 was good. I've never been out for pancakes and seen them cooked so badly. In the end, I didn't bother to say anything (not my style) and left. Pretty disappointing anniversary brunch.","2015-05-03","0","UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw","jTvKXxLigFiw4yyhvp9kjw"

"Terrible customer service, even worse that the owner was so rude and would not return an item when the sales associate who sold them to me said I would be able to. I am never going back and I suggest you don't either. The prices are not even much better for used stuff. Can't believe how rude the people working there especially the owner can be. You mideswell go to a real store with nice associates that are helpful and a manager\/boss that is helpful not rude.Stay far from this place!","2014-07-08","0","_t9UFLwf-uTKq9wLatjXVQ","_rjX-OnuNoYXHYO9BPXItw"

"Dr. Fabito is very well qualified in Pain Management and is a truly caring person. How do I thank a Dr. for not only saving my life but improving my daily pain level? Although my medical history sounds like fiction, Dr. F. listened to it all, took immediate action and ensured I received the truly emergency treatment. Years later, Dr. Fabito continues to provide EXCELLENT care for me and my friends. We adore him! Dr. F. is not a normal Dr. He is both a superior physician and beautiful person.","2016-07-02","0","C5nzMwmMqDWCx-0pRg4h0A","j6jyJdxOsfyu-dWNitZ2Fw"

"Their coffee is great. However the portion is VERY SMALL for the price. (Warning). The flat white coffee drink is tiny (shotglass size) and cappuccino is very small compared to other coffeeshops. For $4 I'd rather have more. It would be nice if they offered different sizes.","2017-05-08","0","0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw","foQvuVJMBhpwuGUCqgh-Yg"

"I had the beef brisket poutine, let's just say the poutine was great MINUS the brisket which tasted like canned dog food. The hush puppies were crispy on the outside but doughy on the inside. I mean it wasn't horrible but I wasn't impressed. I will try again because I heard the sandwiches are good and I'd like to try the shrimp po boy . Oh I also had a butter tart which was delicious but probably not made in store?","2017-06-29","0","iyZlBA4J9qHwEkSIlMCe8A","G4tRq_URi1oLpfKsPpSAtA"

And I had to wait for the next customer for the rest. Cute place though.My crepe itself was tasteless but the filling of eggs, cheese and lots of meat was delish. I had water to drink as they only have flavored teas, their soda fountain was out and the coffee machine broke. Hope this want a typical day.","2016-05-09","0","OYHpqY6-3C-wXR-uPbHhwA","GwFFxVxTVfRzS-OKcMKdcw"

"I have to say unfortunately for the price was disappointed. The aquariums are not that good - not kid height friendly at all.  You shouldn't have to keeping picking up your kids for them to enjoy the tanks. Try sitting in a 7 min carousel like a movies theater just to see sharks and two sea lions and three turtles .  The kids want to be up front at the tank not sitting crammed with other people. The sting ray exhibit was stupid since they were at the bottom of the tank.

"Prices are on par with other locally owned pizza spots.  Let me start off by saying the pizza was good!  We got half the Rocky Reitano half Supremo after the owner suggested we did half and half specialty pizza.  Which was really cool.  Now for the digs.  The staff was way unorganized!  The owner seemed very frazzled and I wouldn't even say they were busy in the least.  Overall good product, service needs major tweaking.  We'll give it another shot! Hopefully they get it together!","2014-09-04","0","xJ94FRxbFwkmpi1hjuWlaw","7BdhgpYYT_XKBce9qzahZA"

How convenient that there are only two cold sandwiches on the whole menu. They should just quote a price for a hot sandwich platter. Instead she offers me individual pricing for sandwiches and you pay all this money, and it doesn't come in a platter. Disappointing to say the least that they are not very accommodating.","2015-05-01","0","TrGBHqHVzJM5tk2C1D1ctQ","DGqUTuDbHEsW73w3Zw_lDg"

"I was excited when I first walked in.  They had a large variety, something for everyone.  I ended up settling for some truffles and chocolates in the main display case where you first enter.

It was horrible.  The chocolate all tasted stale and old.  I got peanut butter nonpareils and they also tasted old and stale.  My friend who was with me also said the same, so I knew it wasn't just me.

Avoid the display chocolates, not sure of the rest.","2016-10-10","0","wjHw2vCIfu17exRWpFwk4g","YrLR4iKol0_RfNuFtcGyrw"

"The caramel fondue with the churro and the homemade rice krispy treats are amazing!
We love to mix the cheeses and have with bread or the pretzels because that is really the only way to do it! Love when they have the yummy pretzels there (sometimes they are those super 8 ones) but if you catch it when they have the soft ones, it is incredible with the cheese.  My husband tried out the sandwich and says it was awesome as well! Keep it up ELF! Love taking our kids on a date here","2017-04-09","0","ZcQBRzwG66TIN3iMiXz5Lw","Bqwm73jm53-c2w8T_FKF3w"

"came out and shown the problem He could not fix it & left. They sent an estimate that was not competitive. Also they said it was suppose to be COD. ISecond, tech did not get a signature and simply wrote, ""no one to sign.""  He could not have gotten into the building if that was the case. Not a bad way to make some money. Go out, not do the work, send a non-competitive estimate knowing the customer would go elsewhere, then charge $99 for an estimate that you did not tell the customer about.","2017-02-13","0","KMcwe97ozzWM0v2tr_qmQw","keayeIvn4cSjoWmBqioWeA"

The people who were running it don't speak spanish. You have to seat yourself and find your own cutlery and napkins which I had to figure on my own as no instruction or information was offered.

"It was Saturday morning my weekend to work. I called to order something for breakfast and the person name ""Alex"" took my order and she's not so friendly at all. She slam the phone after she took my order and she did not even say thank you etc I almost got debt on the other line and just say wow! I'm just hoping that she just have a bad morning and she will have a better mood through the end of the day\/:(

"I want to say that Yelp is an incredibly unscrupulous business to deal with. After refusing to advertise with them, they took our only true REAL reviews and created them as ""Not Recommended"" and left the one ""placed"" that could be proven as a False review and left that one in place. Bottom line DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH YELP!  We would love nothing more than to remove our listing, but YELP now seems to own it.

I explained this to her nail tech multiple times but he just didn't understand anything I said and no one helped him. She ended up with blue and red ties with a bunny on her big toe.

"This is a new spot, and I've heard a lot about long waits, but I was sat in less than 5 minutes. If you have to wait, it's well worth it because the food was good, and the atmosphere comfortable. Great place for a girls\/guys night out. My server was friendly, very knowledgeable, and the foods he recommended were awesome! Try the Mexican Tuna Specialty Roll & Angry Dragon Martini - a perfect pair :) I will review other yummy foods later...","2014-10-26","0","H0xkoPI-WwbjY7r-Zt-arw","TZl5i9ru4Fkxkh15qVJ-Jg"

We sat at the bar first and ordered the Calamari. It was very chewy so we sent it back. The next batch came out even worse.
When we sat at our table it took a while to get service.
We then proceeded to order the ribeye. My wife and I ordered medium rare. Our friends ordered medium.
Our steaks came RARE and our friends came medium rare.
We sent ours back and they came back well done.
At this point we just ate them. Probably the worst tasting ribeye I've had","2015-05-15","0","6qJPWV34kpdC8TUWEZvWOQ","BJLOd-jhaWGnWOpIEDZ0qA"

Tall skinny scowling manager. Yes. A tip for you: smile, be friendly with your guests. You were looking for more people to come in- tip - they won't because you are rude and your food stinks.

"As someone who normally does not like the smokey and saucy nature of register bbq, this place is amazing.  I am craving it again for dinner and we just had it 3 nights ago.  The Brisket is so tender and seasoned perfectly.  The ribs are also tender but the meat is amazing, almost like a spare rib at a Chinese place instead of the fall off the bone kind that tend to dry out and be loaded with sauce.  You will not be disappointed!","2016-08-29","0","zidkKI_N1OPxsiddTOQH_Q","Vc6yKQLg5ZPLgfxCe_jyRQ"

"I've read the reviews of people who got upset for being put on hold or having to wait to get in. Two things: 1) From what I can tell they've added an extra person to the front office for the last few weeks or so. 2) If you're unclear or against medically assisted treatment (buprenorphine\/etc.) you're kind of wasting your time. The science\/stats are out there (It's personally been a lifesaver for me) but the only time I saw a person leave upset she and her husband were arguing in the w\/r about it","2016-06-05","0","GLe0H_2uTY8iUL2qG6oi1w","b3X7CwCrBX6xO8qcEzDLWQ"

The managers were incredibly friendly and easily conveyed the intricacies of the menu. We tres various lamb and chicken dishes with naan that was to die for.

"I ordered the 8 serving super nova cake for my boyfriend's birthday. The cake was awesome! It was a mix of Ferraro Rocher and pistachio. However when we went to pick up the cake, they made a 4 serving cake instead of 8 serving. It was half the size and I had 10 people eating the cake..that was not good at all. Thought their cakes are awesome, I  just got refunded the difference onto a gift card and still charged me fully for that 4 serving cake for 10 people. I guess business for them still.","2016-11-02","0","2_8_ipfxCRtpXesLdBCqig","sIDqGF_l3YPyKUO0ODHi8w"

"I liked the cupcakes the last times I bought from here, but the most recent time was unfortunately a disappointment.    I'm not sure if it was just a bad day. The cupcakes were good, however, the icing was not up to par.  It was not good buttercream, dry, and had a sugary artificial taste.  Im ok with the expense of cupcakes, but I just expect them to really be quality.  Great flavors though, and really cute.   I would go back to see if it was a one off, or if I should go elsewhere from now on","2016-03-13","0","mN0bCGteXHDpUzH2xqrABQ","Ysa0V2BG3bGF-nAxVt1Orw"

However, if they are going to advertise that this restaurant is ""good for kids"" it's probably in their best interest to pay more attention to the music that they are playing. Every song that came on while I was here kept dropping the F bomb among many other curse words. It may have just been a one time fluke, but the restaurant was full of kids and I bet their parents didn't appreciate such inappropriate music being played around their children.","2017-02-07","0","mpG1R1ktTI3x1twNBsGvXQ","8fZ-kM7MlEjSH6Dmvomsbg"

Although both places have excellent food, you cannot beat the attentive and personalized service at Table Thai. Additionally, their prices for savory dishes like Mango Salmon, BBQ Chicken, and fresh rolls (to name a few) are more than reasonable.

"As another said, the food here is worth some service missteps. A Monday night with slow business and slow service but excellent cocktail and meal.  Surprised that it is so quiet and the service not up to par, it seems they don't have enough staff so either a scheduling error or hustling for their customers issue. But it is a Monday and we've all had one of those days so I'll give 'em that.","2015-08-24","0","A7gK6ZrGy939Zo43xNZcVw","FGh5WAvwIqKSoRQwn91qLw"

"Don't make my mistake -- it turns out there are 2 Chinese restaurants in Lakewood that deliver on the BeyondMenu app. We made a horrible mistake and ordered from the WRONG restaurant. 

Let's just say it's a mistake we will remember a long while. If you use the link from the New China King website you'll be set -- and have a fabulous meal.","2016-01-03","0","uuQDpnCYn1Nf2pXZTtMLHg","FGh5WAvwIqKSoRQwn91qLw"

Don't use the one Yelp lists unless calling. The link for ordering has been broken for over a year.  For online ordering do not use www.newchinakinglakewood.com   If you try to place an online order here you'll get an error message and no Chinese food.

"I haven't been to Fit Factory, but I've worked out with Tony A. many times. I feel like some reviews based on a single class that portray him as being almost mean are not totally accurate. He's very tough, but not a bad guy at all.  I was intimidated by the yelling at first, but really he's trying to help you have the best workout possible. After a couple of classes I was hooked. As we got to know him, we learned just how warm and funny he is. We were so sad when he left that gym!","2015-11-05","0","PN1k_53s-BsSSmMU2KIIzw","xjre9hfTcMzZU1B6BwvWoA"

"We went ""go green pasta"" and grillete salmon (the only fish option, But a super good one). Everything was super tasty! Prices are ok, not the cheapest but affordable, and worth it! The place is very nice, comfy bar area inside. The patio is my kind of place to eat, get some drinks and talk. Don't get to close to the borders bc you get some homeless asking for dollars, not cool if you are trying to enjoy ur meal... The service is good!

She took the time to explain what she was doing and checked in to make sure I was comfortable. She is clearly well- educated, caring, and very good at what she does.

I ask do you guys have dumplings (place is called Bang Bang Dumplings).  I'm told ""we don't have any cuz we don't want to turn on the steam oven cuz it is 2 hot outside"".  I leave w\/o ordering.

I get it is hot but then why show up if you aren't going to serve your main draw.  I'm sure the cooks in the other food trucks weren't turning people away cuz of the heat.  What's that saying, if you can stand the heat get out of the food truck kitchen.","2015-07-10","0","l1UsAzBjRgLxgAWT6zgOFA","0Ui6sjLLM86hc5IRy4vngA"

The only flaw was the Jasmine Rice, it was underdone and chewy.   Service was not as good as the last time, think it may be due to shift changes or something, we waited a long time for everything.

Definitely will not be going back. A friend of mine told me her husband got sick as well. They really need to change what they're doing.

The owner surprized me with a taste of his new Maui wings. The wing meat was comparable with other wing places, juicy, meaty, but the favor was such a pleasant surprize. LOVED THEM!

At first we were a bit disappointed as my husband wanted AYCE and I wanted hibachi dinner. Well you can't do both so if we wanted to eat that we would need to eat separately. So we went for AYCR which I am glad we did. We truly enjoyed our dinner. We got to try a bunch of items and found out the food was excellent. Very flavorful and fresh!

"Here is a tip. Don't go there. I got kicked out and I wasn't even there.  What kind of management is that.  This is a text I received from the management:

It from the owner and to be quite honest the patrons complained online about how they take over and are disrespectful. When I address a problem I don't get cussed. Out  No respect for me or my daughter or the other bartenders it's just not working out.

They is referring to those who ride bikes.  So Julie G is full of crap!!!","2015-12-04","0","whY2KIvO60ZZwRceqzkqyw","2cDTX5IMHqI30mSkArNeoA"

"I wrote a review about 7months ago raving about how amazing this place is... I would like to rescind my praise because in the past few months quality has plummeted. I am only guessing, but it seems like a few months ago they switched product providers to a lower quality... please!

"K-30x class times are pretty inconsistent. Twice now I've been left waiting for over 15 minutes for an instructor to show and open the studio.

My first workout was enjoyable. Sweated, grunted and punched the heck out of the bag. I'd just like to get in more regularly.

It's disappointing as I've been looking for a place to workout that's not crossfit and is close to home. Thought this would have been the place. Guess it.","2016-04-30","0","N_fepIdc09HjroGbVU6kew","hfgc6mq4psjjJy-T2AjBfw"

"I'm pretty sure this place is a front for some sort of money-laundering operation. Every time I've eaten here, it has taken SO incredibly long to get our food that I am convinced that this place could not possibly stay in business if there wasn't something illegal going on. That said, the food is quite good. Fresh fish and salad, tasty fries. The staff disappears for long periods of time, presumably to cook the food, so you may have to wait a while to pay.

"I ate here and agree they are friendly service and amazing food. I watched my lobster roll be prepared and they absolutely brush butter on and grill each side on the skillet. Its not fully toasted, but it's buttered and warmed. Everything is made to order and I'm sure if you asked they would have prepared the buns to your liking! What an amazing view they have too! I'm sad for them their 5 5star reviews were kicked off. Now they are a 4* It's a great little place though, headed there today!","2015-04-30","0","XFhpL8cZgax0RnMdhWaugg","YD9dYlKUgR0nJb6Jkkf9_w"

"Tip is for Yippie S. A Lobster Roll comes on a HOT DOG ROLL (hence the name Lobster ROLL) traditionally and that is what they make, traditional Maine lobster rolls made to order and NOT pre-mixed junk. From your 3 reviews it is apparent that nobody pleases you so this place is better off if you stayed away. It's clear you know nothing about Maine lobster rolls anyway. As far as flavorless, well that's ones opinion and as I said, it's clear nothing satisfies you. I am a regular regardless!","2015-11-24","0","XFhpL8cZgax0RnMdhWaugg","YD9dYlKUgR0nJb6Jkkf9_w"
"Michele, Apologies for your disappointment in the fact that the restaurant was closed for Winter Break which inconvenienced YOU, however it has been closed with a sign on the door advising of winter break since 12\/26. They also posted on the social media they were closing for break. I frequent this place a lot as I live in the Village and it is well worth it for a visit and has unbelievable food and service but assure you it does not SUCK like your attitide towards the Village does.

The place was nowhere near full and our server was not the only one on the floor, so I have no idea what the issue was.   Our water was never replenished, our dishes were never cleared (we had to clear them on our own onto an adjacent table) and we could never find out server when we needed one.","2016-07-25","0","klu0zF1rWAoNAhKPsFyUog","PQ3a95GBtuVVfCr3beBFSA"

I'd been there before (always getting the eggplant parmigiana) but this time went with a seasonal special...sweet potato pizza with marscapone cheese, pancetta & other stuff. Delicious! (I also took home the eggplant parmigiana). Not only was the food great but the server, Tony, managed to handle four rowdy senior ladies with ease, precision & friendliness! Thanks Tony!","2017-10-18","0","y6QP5IrOJ7_FsB51jN2_Jg","axKL0K040sC1ihD0aqZGfw"

"After every 15-30 mins, take the coals off of the top with the tong you get with your sheesha, and place it on the metal plate. Tap it a few times to take the ash off. When satisfied, place it back on top. Alternatively, just call their sheesha guy, and he'll fix it fast. If the smoke or favour is too strong for you, their sheesha guy is kind enough to fix it for you.","2015-08-08","0","fXScQNUXwoUS2TgRFr8NjA","0GoKje_Vqa269NcR-NoY7g"

"Here's the scoop, every aspect of the experience was disappointing. It took the staff 10 minutes to acknowledge us, when 4 staff members were standing around. Once acknowledged it was nonsensical and sarcastic. He did not ask us what we wanted, instead ignored and had more nonsensical banter. Finally, after 15 uncomfortable minutes we ordered. Each of the 3 orders had to be repeated and corrected multiple times, and to top it all off the ice cream was sub par.

"If you're interested in shopping or consigning, bear in mind that the price the buyer pays gets split 50\/50 with the store (standard consignment, from my experience consigning handmades).

"If you came to go out at night and sleep in, this hotel IS NOT for you. 

I am currently staying on the fifth floor and the staff has decided to roll around a dolly and make loud operations prep noises beginning at 6:15 AM!

"燈光美、氣氛佳、服務讚！個人大推拉斯維加斯一定要來美食餐廳～是說本來只是抱著看到耶噗推薦，半喜半憂的以可能採雷的心理來看看嘗試嘗試，不大好找的胡亂繞了兩圈，赫然發現一個不大起眼的店面、還以為又要被泰皮中骨的異國美食給虛晃了，一進門像入了愛麗絲仙境的高檔咖啡廳，冰開水飄浮的是草莓，桌上竟有蠟燭配玫瑰花？湯飯沙拉一上桌，買尬，這不是我們凡人吃的吧？我從沒吃過泰式料理是這般溫和順口但該辣該酸的沒少一點半分，沒有重鹹或舌麻，我撐到喉頭也要把這整桌給嗑完！肚皮鼓鼓，荷包卻沒扁扁，泰國人真太幸福惹～～","2017-01-02","0","cyzOijFJ82cae6qH6L8vuw","jo8iU_jzu5DFZIcShOCSqw"
