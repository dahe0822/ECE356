More than just sushi on the menu... rice bowls, chicken teriyaki,  gyoza, etc. I was hoping for more traditional sushi choices, so it was hard to find rolls without cream cheese and crazy sauces. But they have creative specials & would be good for more adventurous sushi lovers. I got a tekka maki roll (tuna), sake (salmon on a ball of rice), & miso soup. Yummy meal, but I'm going to keep looking for somewhere more authentic.","2013-07-20","0","oudIKQI8HjqJqiF9pnMmQw","kxYYCmcGVvU4idDu5hj5qQ"

OMG, it was so delicious! They have this Scottish salmon that was so fresh and with the Siracha and Asian pesto sauce, I have to say it was one of the best rolls I've had.

"Awesome and authentic describes this place to a T!  It is my favorite Italian spot that isn't uppity.  Always try the features but if you aren't feeling those, they can even make you something not on the menu to satisfy that craving. They used to have this dish on the menu but took it off and Everytime I go they make it for me!  Tagliatelle d'alba. Basically it's a pasta with truffles and mushrooms and a poached egg on top!  Not to be missed!  Try the beef carpaccio as well!  Bellissimo!","2013-04-02","0","JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg","32mKuGcYhdwtrB_SHnErZQ"

We had to ask multiple times for beverages, my boyfriend never received his dessert, and our pizza was brought out incorrectly made & then taken away. After waiting 40 mins for our 2nd pizza the bartender comped the price of the topping and i had to get my food to go.  I left starving and disappointed.

"Even with the pending closure days away the owner berated a table of old ladies for wanting separate check and even caused the waitress to cry. Most likely a daily occurrence. 
They had their opportunity to clean up their act with Robert Irvine but resorted back to the old crappy ways. 
The owner is widely known throughout the city as treating her staff like crap. 
Hopefully in the last day or so her staff will give it back to her.

"If you have any dietary restrictions or needs, check your food yourself (beyond them showing you your food) before leaving. I've ordered food vegan and, probably 75% of the time, have gotten it back with problems that make it not vegan.

"A home repair should be defined as Jeremy The Handyman. Some reviews mentioned higher estimates. I'd rather pay to have it done the right way. We all want repairs in this manner as opposed to when other guy does it over 3 times, triples the cost, effort and results are only satisfactory. Use a professional with a huge heart, cares about his work, employees and business. Any home repairs or handyman work in general you need finished, my tip is to use these guys for everything you care about!","2017-04-18","0","zg_N8jFAos1D4xeUkKUZ5A","j_2HxZ34zkwc58ztwEp5rw"

"Ridiculous. We arrived at 11:35PM and they refused to serve us because we arrived at midnight. Yes, the nightclub portion opened at midnight but there was 25 minutes remaining for food service. Evidently, they don't wish to maximize profits by turning customers away 25 minutes prior to closing.

"All the prior reviews are correct service sucks!! We waited almost five minutes to be seated at a dirty table.  It was another five minutes before the server came over.  I advised our table was dirty.  He asked if we were ready to order.   After waiting ten minutes we had to ask him to wipe the table.   He did apologize and brought us place mats. I've been to other locations and service was nothing like this.","2016-06-02","0","wztnDEbXD1VNvHMMPj2tMw","i1uxiSzD715umPRAxp2dIA"

So I asked for more soup, and yes, they are giving you chicken soups and it cost $3 :) sweet huh? A rice bowl size of soup cost $3.

"I had never tried Indian food before but I heard good things about KP.Not knowing what to order the young lady up front helped me out(unwillingly). I ordered to go but the decor was nice inside. I really enjoyed what I got, a lamb vinitori I believe. It was not dry given it was the end of the day, it was mega spicy which was great and the nan(sp)was amazing.It tasted very fresh, I had added garlic for $1 more.Food was great but the price was a bit much for take out alone.$15 Overall good stuff!","2013-05-21","0","biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg","A91tNuUS6_4ZFcRMps94Zg"
"My boyfriend and I were looking for a Mexican restaurant somewhere near Glendale and came across Anaya's. The service was great. The waitress was very helpful and attentive when need be. Both of its being from El Paso TX, we are always sceptical of Mexican restaurant and we were both very pleased. The menu has a good variety without flooding you with choices, they have a fully stocked bar and the bathrooms were very clean. Could be great for a dinner in or a quick bite to go. We will be back.","2013-04-28","0","Kj8rXSpMQlFOP2iWN0fXYA","A91tNuUS6_4ZFcRMps94Zg"

I dont think its a place to spend all night but the great offer they have and cool vibe make it a great spot to pass by during night .

"Had a less than stellar experience at this restaurant. At the peak of the Sunday brunch, I checked in at the outdoor stand and surprisingly was immediately seated at an outdoor table. I went to get my wife in the parking lot and 2 minutes later returned to the table to find it occupied by another couple. I went back to the check in stand 10 feet away and was shown to another table that was dirty and in a direct path to the waiters' entrance. No one apologized, just a schrug.I will never go back.","2013-07-28","0","jYqOPpSmtKbKzf0Z_g-Oyg","LkQaflSUjrvyHFf7cQ6R8w"

"I live close by, and was excited to try this place. I ordered takeout, and was very disappointed. The salad was small and boring, the calamari was chewy and over-fried, and the meat lasagna, which I was craving, tasted gamey (not a good thing). Worst of all was the zeppoli. They were soggy, and tasted like they were fried in old, used oil. I threw them away. I may come back for the pizza, as I've heard good thing about it.

The overall atmosphere inside Crush at MGM is classy, garden chic. With the green tones, rocks and trees inside the restaurant, Crush is both comfortable and impressive. The menu is gluten-free too!

"Well I've been here a few times and never was disappointed. However the server today was horrible and constantly had to remind him he forgot items we ordered. It was a long wait to get items that didn't need 30 min to prepare. Over all the food was delicious and stuffed our faces to the point I was nauseated when I left. Price was good for the all you can eat and loved the mussels and spicy tuna. Not sure if I'll be back anytime soon due to being highly disappointed in the service.","2014-01-20","0","Gaq3S9lmjXVcuDCZ8ulppw","r3URYPAbRSgFDeDgBidQ3w"

Anytime you walk by, you need to check on each of your tables instead of neglecting them. If it's too much, simply ask for help.

The girl still didn't help me. I had ordered an ice cream sandwich cake and all I needed was to pick it up. I will never buy anything for this location again. When a customer walks in they should be greeted always, even if you are helping another customer.","2014-06-15","0","h5DJK4b3b6_VuI-iImC2fg","hhRNqo2rpnnfb_E4f2ug2w"

"Note:  the key to good coffee is freshly roasted beans.  If you're going add a load of crap to your coffee, you have no one to blame but yourself if you don't like the end result.  People who drink stale, crappy coffee (pr charred coffee from THAT PLACE) add loads of crap because stale and\/oe charred coffee tastes like dirt.

"We had Outer Reef Burritos. I had the  Ono added guacamole and sour cream. Hubby had steak sub red sauce for green. My burrito was good but it was dry. I asked for more green sauce and that made a difference. Hubby said his steak was good but could use more seasoning. The Maui Onion Rings were over done and greasy. The place can be noisy at times. Great place for families. We will be back! The staff was pleasant. Thank you Callie, Tracy and Juan.

If one person is taking orders on phone have someone else attend to person waiting. Also watched them get an order mixed up...The front end just needs improving.

There will always be haters because people's tastes are differ and you just can't please everyone all of the time.  But you had a chance to make a comeback and you blew it because of a bruised ego. It would be a shame to see your dreams go up in smoke because you can't let go of the past.","2013-05-16","0","DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA","faLL1uIYS6ctvN9TUJxKnw"

"Dear Amy,
  You honestly need to stop cooking. My food was disgusting, cold, and the only thing good was the staff. (By staff I don't mean yourself and your filthy husband that needs to shower). Your attitude is just as bad as the food and we could here you screaming in the back. We actually were afraid you might have been getting raped back there but then you reared your face and we saw you were just yelling at the employees. Don't eat here peeps. Go to McDonalds instead.","2013-05-17","0","DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA","XwfLrurAShAWUvxPNAn95w"

"To those of you who think a failure to have dined at Amy's should  disqualify a review, I pose this question. If you gave a restaurant five stars but later learned that the chef spit in your food would your opinion rightfully be influenced by the luggy hacked into your gumbo? Of course. So why shouldn't non-diners be able to draw conclusions from a reality show?

I also get the Bosco sticks, they aren't on the menu but they are cheese filled breadsticks served with marinara sauce. You get 4 pretty big sticks for 6 something and it's a nice appetizer everyone cannot resist.","2015-04-23","0","oglIZt5mg2nErhpTH_AakQ","C4OWo_yoZQBlYLW7BH5fgQ"

"So I landed myself a reservation here, after thinking I would get a Marriott hotel through Priceline's express booking. These reviews make me cringe! *sigh* I have to make the most out of my birthday weekend.

Here are some tips to enhance your experience:

Bring extra sheet, blanket, and pillows.

Buy candles and incense to get rid of any smell. 

Buy Shower flip flops! (You will thank me).

Bring slippers.

Bring\/buy a mini fan & household cleaner.

We had a mixture of vegans and carnivores in the group and everyone found plenty of options to suite their palettes. The service was also excellent! Very accommodating and nice. And, best of all, the prices and portions were superb! Overall, an excellent experience!","2013-06-11","0","LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg","nQaGs2L0e9TspesEVkydNg"

"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to in Phoenix! We got samosas to start, chicken tikka tandoori, chicken korma, lamb kofta curry, and plain naan. Everything was pretty delicious! The chicken korma was better than I think I've ever had! And I really enjoyed the chicken tikka tandoori! The naan is wonderful also! The samosa wasn't the best one I've had, it was still good and big portions! I would highly recommend!","2014-03-31","0","LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg","OIgSMLPKe1PDtP5I-1FrWA"

They give you complimentary chips and salsa with beandip. I ordered the appetizer platter and everything was amazing very Americanized Mexican food though.

"NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I paid $45 for the deluxe pedi and was finished much sooner than i had expected. I pointed out twice an ingrown toenail that I had and she still didn't get it out. They were FANTASTIC with my daughter, but I really feel that i was slighted. I also felt rushed to chose a color and the girl was making her own decisions and made me change my final choice for my manicure. While the ambiance is PHENOMENAL and trendy with great color selections, the service is well below average.","2013-06-17","0","gLOc1Fzl8yuKGq7B1TWj_A","qTRB6zIjbt8Jwnx9hW9Kfw"

"This place is awful! This was my second attempt at a gel manicure here. Both time the gel lifted in one week! This last time I returned to ask to have it redone and they agreed to fix it for free which was great...however the girl who redid my nails left them uneven and i noticed one was even chipped upon leaving the salon. I was also yelled at by her when I asked if I could choose a different glitter color for an accent nail. I will def not recommend and not be back to this salon.","2013-06-20","0","gLOc1Fzl8yuKGq7B1TWj_A","Rz4N6hHqiAaoozDqSHgRTg"

"Holy Restaurant Supply Batman! This place has it all. They have so much in stock and on hand it's incredible. Yes they are open to the public and have tons of dining furniture on hand to purchase in quantities small to large. I can't even begin to describe how cool this store was. I felt like I was on iron chef with the commercial grade equipment, and the staff was so awesome (even though I was purchasing a relatively small quantity of 4 to 6 dining room chairs). Highly recommend.","2014-02-12","0","saojSJ2tJn04PLHDbOT6qg","kh75EOjF4h9g-weJJ0quoQ"

"This is completely ridiculous. Before I love going to this place, but today's experience is beyond unacceptable.  First of all, apparently there is a new policy (that wasn't informed nor stated on the menu) that there is 2 limit per sides.  Second of all, the waitress is completely rude.

"In Charlotte for the first time.. Decided to drop in. Although appointments  appreciated as the card says. My barber was Damien... Very professional and thorough in his barber skills. I got a lining and clean up on my beard, then went ahead and asked him to cut my hair down some. When it was all said and done; he did a magnificent job. I highly recommend this place. It has a great energy, the barbers are top notch, and the results are outstanding. I will definitely be returning. They got skills!","2014-02-04","0","Z995CrUg177hi-I3IDFMIA","X79X26_W1y0_vRndXBemdg"

And tasted the Mr. ho burger which had lup cheong...which he enjoyed.  The pineapple ketchup with fries was something different.  Overall i enjoyed my meal.  Will be back to try other dishes.

We were forced to pay an extra $850 fee that built up month to month even though they made the mistake to not put it on our bill when I would go to the front office each month to see exactly what I owed.

"Fun!HIGHLY recommend them to anyone getting married in Vegas, regardless of your wedding style: wacky Elvis or Hangover theme or romantic in Ceasar's Palace Garden.

"I'd consider this the big and more mature, quite classy, version of Chipotle. The ingredients are fresh, the tortillas are excellent and homemade, and their options are more diverse. I got the salad with pulled chicken and it was excellent. However I must say, these portions are far too big for a single person. I split this with a friend and we had leftovers. A great bargain and if you do it right it can even be a great healthy option for lunch!","2013-07-03","0","xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ","XBQNTNhkO6V86ewbg7Lnlw"

Evidently the packer put it in a bag by itself, separate from the food items, and did not put it in my cart. I called the store. The representative took my name and phone number and said they would call me ""if anyone turned it in."" 
Seriously?  He didn't take my word for?  I doubt that anyone will turn it in. I'll never shop there again. Poor customer service!","2017-06-10","0","hc009HrrwaVRjg0PTpy-_w","yAi-b330jN_uwaIhpehW1A"

However after reading all the really bad experiences with every single CL customer it seems, from the billing to customer service to poor connections....FORGET IT! While Cox may have some poor connectivity issues they at least have decent customer service. Century Link appears to be twice as worse!

"We were walking through the Venetian when we saw this place. I wanted a steak, and I heard great things about this place. Even without a reservation, we were promptly seated. I got the Mac and cheese, broccoli, and the potato purée as sides for my 14 oz. Nebraska cut. It was a very tasty meal with incredible service considering our impromptu arrival. I would recommend this place for a fine evening in dining, however it was extremely expensive.","2013-05-05","0","J4CATH00YZrq8Bne2S4_cw","S03fPzq1FfUbVx76Z_XHrw"

"Came here on a Tuesday night. They had live music and they were all wonderful! Love that they played their own songs as well covers. Ate the green chili taco which were delicious, although there was a little too much sauce on them. The beer on the outside patio was a little warm. I'm not sure if it was because the kegs were outside or because they have to run the kegs lines from inside. I will not be ordering draft  beers from the outside patio. The servers were great though.

"Make your own bloody Mary's bar is awesome. However I would sit inside vs. outside, especially during summer. Even with their amazing patio. Their mister system is not working and we ended up with ants on our table. Their service is pretty good. Amanda was pleasant and always had a smile on her face. Their food is decent for a bar. I got the California burger but sub the guac for avocado. Don't think there should be an extra charge for that though. Over all it's a decent bar for the conscience.","2013-05-19","0","TfcQhrjJco0C_x0KVK7LwA","Mc2sf6v8kQGFj-NAeRGphQ"

"Ein absolutes Muss für alle USA Besucher. Wer erstmal die frisch zubereiteten Pommes, die Burger (wie auf dem Plakat) und besonders den süchtig machenden Schoko-Milchshake probiert hat, der versteht auch die lange Warteschlange (40 min im Drive Inn) -Tip: im Auto wartet es sich viel bequemer.
Es gibt Hamburger, Cheeseburger und DoubleDouble (doppelt Käse, Doppelt Fleisch).
Als Vegetarier hatte ich den Grilled Cheese, also Käse statt Fleisch. Und zu den Pommes Extra Spread. Lecker 5 Sterne","2014-08-09","0","nVAJZ6BJ9PPlxDXn976R6A","gT8zOxjVjtwpH2cGSiVY6w"

Food was good but not worth the wait. The staff is rude and only two people take orders which is stupid.

My sliders were cold, my son's asada tacos had too much fat, and my daughter's pizza was undercooked! The worst part was as we were walking out the restaurant the female manager comes to apologize about the long wait and offered to adjust our bill, but my husband already paid.

A good place to being a group even if someone's not so into sushi. The menu is excellent. Also great sake selection.

They give you a choice of fries, onion rings salad. I picked the onion rings an and they were so tough. Seems they refried them or something because the onion inside wasn't soft.

Miso soup was also very delicious and it was served really hot this was a plus. The chicken teriyaki bowl was a very large portio. Defenitly more rice than chicken but still a descent amount of chicken. very flavorful as well. Great atmosphere for a date or just a hangout and get some drinks kinda place.

The van drivers probably don't have licenses and gas it on yellow lights, take corners at intersections at high speeds and drive incredibly recklessly.

The wagyu beef gyozas and the tempura string beans are to die for plus the cocktails are absolutely delightful. Our server, Vanessa, was such a sweetheart too. She surprised my best friend and I with dessert that made for a perfect finishing touch. I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed. If anything, you will be just as impressed as we were! Can't wait to go back!","2015-05-18","0","pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA","yRq4bkU7rTHmJkoRSwrxOQ"

"I was so excited to find out about the ling and Louie's in Scottsdale because it's much closer to me then the regular one I drive to in chandler (wild horse pass); however, I was very disappointed. My absolute favorite dish on the menu is the calamari and at the Scottsdale location did not hold up to the ling and Louie's standards. It was just too breaded and on the verge of being burnt crispy.","2013-11-08","0","SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ","tUX7bI7SvGJMo74Zyagizg"

"We love Ling & Louie's. The service is friendly and the food is consistently delicious. The calamari is the best we've ever eaten anywhere, and we have traveled a lot in the last 30 years. Everything I have ever tried there has been great. My husband and my adult son like it, too, as do my girlfriends who like to lunch and everybody else I know who has eaten there.

Even though they were crazy busy, our order was ready in 15 minutes. BEST French toast I have had at a restaurant!

The fish pita was good, not great. That is uncommon. The tartar sauce wasn't quite right and I tried the Fiery Feta as well. I won't do that again. Just not as tasty as I would expect from Showmars.

I totally don't see the extreme negative issues that some people are complaining about and believe I would not hesitate to post if I saw these issues. The only concern I have is the few people that drive fast in the garage which makes it dangerous when making turns to the next level.

"Drive thru is slow as hell. 12 minutes sitting here.

Then I get home and I have the wrong order. I call the store twice and no one answers. Guess I will never come back here.

Waited until the next day to call and again the phone just rings and rings. I'm feeling like someone just took advantage or me  ran a scam on me, although that isn't true that is how I am feeling.

"Totally underwhelmed with management. The manager and a handful of waitstaff are joking around at the podium. Glad they have things under control at the front door, never mind the patrons who are being ignored. I finally got up and fetched our drinks from the bar myself. Food isn't bad, but not as good as I've had at other locations. Signature dish Changs spicy chicken was over cooked, sauce congealed.","2016-01-25","0","fJCsDc353UC6eUn-kCBrGw","yXw13vZtZi-J9xDW_GHxSA"

"This place was absolutely horrible and that's being way too kind. It took about 20 minutes for someone to even come to our table. Then it took another 25 to get our cold, awful food. WAY over priced. The menu was tacos or burritos..that's it. The food had no flavor at all. Will never go there again.","2012-10-05","0","I1qgWmIEIpnZF-uj6F-aCw","PhQvJsYdE1Jbs5QnNgcrvQ"

The bad:
Service is blah. The plate they brought out with the sauces had hair on it. We advised the staff of this, they took the plate in the back, wiped it off, and brought back the exact same plate, with the exact same sauces. 
Then, they brought us plates to share our salad. One plate was dirty. It had food caked on it. The chicken was overcooked. The wings were not edible. And, to top it all off, the chicken had no flavor. Pio Pio in NY is far better!","2014-11-24","0","--cZ6Hhc9F7VkKXxHMVZSQ","WK0R6JgLM77a9DyuwzGMBw"

"My son wanted to come here for his 17th birthday on July 12. We had patronized Teharu Sushi for years and had many good meals. However, after a previous visit about 2 months ago, I had a stomachache the next day, and I had full-blown food poisoning the day after my son's birthday dinner. I have never seen the chefs remove old sushi from the conveyor belt... I am not going to risk going back again! My son and I are both disappointed to cross this restaurant off our list of choices.","2013-07-18","0","t53w4JlkxTau-G-TzhSWog","sBVSGiPv9WLpB9i2iwyt3w"

"The only thing good about the Palms, is the staff. Freindly and they really want to help. Beyond that it misses the luxury mark by miles. We stayed two nights in the Ivory Tower on 52nd floor. Room rate is over 500 a night. (That isn't a mis type either 500.00 per night) I have stayed at Thrump Tower for a MUCH better room for 129.00 per night. Want a cheap room, Palms would be okay if the rate is less than 70 per night. I won't be back.","2013-05-23","0","_ZfjpSEO5ntk-1hbnwCR4g","WQ2EL3GlahSFBSQ7FDfH8Q"

"I'll keep this short and sweet.  The chicken was ok, in my opinion not worth the price (20 wings for $21.95).  I asked for a side of sauce to dip my chicken in and the server and subsequently the manager told me no. Apparently it's company policy to deny a side of sauce to protect their recipe.  I have a real problem with this, who's the customer anyway? Moreover, if I can identify the ingredients of your sauce by taste then I can do it just tasting the chicken.  The service was good though.","2016-08-22","0","k-tg18rWRibZ4jKpoqhb0Q","2jqVF_Voc6Da9FOHDLfFKA"

"Great food to be honest but make sure you count your change! The hostesses employ a new method called ""rounding up""; or as I like to call it: stealing or forcing a tip for walking their skinny-jean clad butts  5 feet to the kitchen to get your to go order that they did not cook. You can also expect a healthy dose of entitled adolescent attitude paired with an owner who does not take lying or stealing from their customers seriously as they make excuses for their staff.

My input: If ur reluctant to toss old food out bcuz u couldn't sell all of it u'll ended up over-seasoning dishes & customers won't come back. also, when addressed an issue don't argue cuz u'll never win the customer's repeat business even if u win the argument.

"One word, terrible. We asked for a minute to choose our drinks and had to ask for a waiter after about 15 minutes. Then it took half an hour to get them and another 20 for our food. The brown rice was rock hard, the pasta was oily, and the baked ""Mac and cheese"" was a gooey, gross bowl of cheese with half a handful of macaroni. The waiters would ignore us or talk over us whenever we tried to talk. People were eating before us that got there long after us.","2013-06-24","0","t6WY1IrohUecqNjd9bG42Q","0yfiq2gmSthLDJsibW9nAw"

"Cafe 1845 just put up new paper menu and pricing signs. Beware because these signs are not correct! The sign at the sandwich area clearly states that you may also get a small bowl of soup included with your sandwich. Even though they are aware of it, the cashiers will charge you for it, and give you attitude when you question it. I had to get the manager involved, and he was polite about it and allowed me to get my soup.

We arrived at 3:30 PM and was told by the waitress that the kitchen wouldn't open until around 4:30 PM.  We were not looking to have sushi as our only part of our dish and to ask us an hour later if we'd like to order from the dinner menu was slightly off putting.","2017-01-26","0","2pV-BNJvTL3f3EiMZlv6_w","jl479BWC70B2X3C2-Bz4Wg"

"This place was mediocre at best. The only thing that was good were the Kim chi pancakes. The lo mein tasted like the only seasoning was soy sauce. Everything else that was shared was very bland and boring. Place looks great but menu needs makeover and new chef ASAP or will not last long.","2013-02-12","0","UbMtPSMcyWbrceQK9OjDQw","v0C-XiHW7PrlMIuYKyxWVQ"

Their IPA ""Seven"" is average. The most consistent accommodation I received over the 5 times was the slow service. Plan on waiting awhile to order anything. I am not sure if they need more people or what. Service is part of the equation for a successful restaurant to be prosperous.

Selection was decent but food tasted very generic. I. From NY and honestly you would not be able to tell a difference from an average grade Chinese buffet. Maybe I was hoping for more since the only restaurants labeled seafood buffets are wayyyy more higher end buffets.","2013-10-23","0","pfyH89xsKRasjCp1j9z3vw","rZvis9Acm6-L7jDBctGRPA"

"The food is not outstanding but is good and filling. I wish they cared about their salsa, though. Seems as though they throw some tomato sauce in a bowl, add a tiny bit of cilantro, and serve it. No seasoning or care taken in its preparation. Aren't you supposed to taste food as you prepare it? They have always had the worst salsa around here.

"I am a longtime customer and Jimmy Bearden said he wanted to buy my backup SUV Ford Explorer they had worked on. He tells me he will pick it up at my home and never shows on three different days he agreed to. He ignored my text and phone messages. He finally says he is so busy that I would have to drive it to him. I agree and he then says he is too busy to prep it for resale and reneges on his offer. This guy tied up my SUV for 2 weeks and wastes my time. What an asshole!","2016-05-18","0","5il5YyMEDQrjJjDI-ranBQ","ZfMoZissJjvvrPDyBsetLw"

"On 9\/19\/16, I wrote a strong 5 star review in praise of New York's Best Italian Bistro. My wife had made me a 60th birthday party at New York's Best for 42 guests that was outstanding in every way. 

I wrote a bona fide thoughtful well deserved review as a highly satisfied customer. I gave my full name and City. My review was posted for a day and then removed by Yelp without a stated reason. This upset me.

My review should be posted and Yelp should honor its system.","2016-09-24","0","FyKefsWq62xeXpje0Flcig","qp-VtUoh3GzX-lilaeq6sg"

But ( yes unfortunately there is a but), it must have been the outside bar that leads into the dining room. Flies were surrounding our table! Sorry but I'm not a fan of flies or any other rodent when I'm trying to eat indoors, for that matter.

"My girlfriend and I have been to The Keg many times before.  Our last visit was one we won't forget. The timing for the drinks, meal and dessert were perfect. As sincere and hard working as the entire staff is, I would like to especially call out Jaime for her excellent customer service. She was absent yet attentive and was always there at the exact time we needed her.  We will continue to go to the Keg, but will request Jaime in advance because she was that good.","2013-09-03","0","Dqzkdf0sz8lm9AFjfsDmIw","ZHqc-6L2SjKPFjIZiOTvrw"

"I love this place especially Tuesday with the discounted wings at $0.60 each with 4 minimum. You can really try several different flavors without breaking the bank. HOWEVER, I would stay away from the bar. I have never seen such un attentive bartenders.  They will clean the bar around you without making eye contact or ask you if you need anything. They hang with the regulars chatting and you need to really wave and say ""excuse me"" to get their attention and then never a smile, just blank stare.","2015-01-21","0","VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw","9MffzmWxz0Q1CJRV5I0UPw"

"!! OVERLY STUFFED AND SATISFIED !!

I came across this estabilshment via yelp and was a little skeptical but went with a hunch based on reviews.  I'm typically a taste of home cooking which this establishment probably isn't.  Probably a catered a tad to western taste if you ask me......but definitely a flavorful and enjoyable experience.

I am satisfied!....and will come here again! :)","2015-12-20","0","hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g","JM4Bi7bEYmF8kM09f3cKkg"

"Preparing for a move can be a daunting task. I advise my potential customers to first sell or donate items they do not want to move. Second, plan and prepare early on by selecting things that can be packed that you won't need until after you are in your new home. Use quality boxes and pack heavy items in smaller boxes. Tape and label every box clearly. Stack boxes neatly out of walking paths. To save time and money disassemble and label parts of any thing that needs to taken part for your move.","2015-10-22","0","8OQReNtWRuBQcFTP8TZgNw","NIJFn-wjLHjVSnEm9S4eaw"

Side note: while we were seated at the bar, we and several employees  got to watch  as a liquid from the apartment above dripped, then flowed from the ceiling into the space behind the bar.  We paid as fast as we could (a real challenge at this place) and fled. I hope the ceiling didn't cave in!","2015-09-20","0","KrY9xTnZtUVGMeSF4D7okA","i_4JP5Co6WZqgoPHnIPh4g"
