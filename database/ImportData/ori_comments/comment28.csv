"Décor à la bonne franquette, personnel sympatique, apportez votre vin, aucun luxe mais c'est propre. En table d'hôte nous avons aimé la soupe de style dhal mais trop tiède. Le repas végé fût un lit de couscous avec des légumes trop cuit sans préparation particulière et sans saveur digne d'un resto de ces vieux pays. Pour ma compagne, même assiette + poulet sec et fade + mijoté de bœuf très savoureux. Pourtant le resto était rempli mais nous n'avons pas apprécié l'expérience.","2016-01-30","0","lbNrAWLlxOKw1lS_DKvziQ","4yLOuC0hGmPFk7f2Y7db1w"

They are inconsistent with their level of spice so be mindful of that if you are ""heat sensitive"". The desserts aren't amazing, but their main courses have been really good so far!  

Soup: chic pea, lemongrass - delicious!
App: Tempeh satay - good but a little dry, si maybe ask for more sauce!
Main: ""crab"" cakes - fantastic!

Last time i was there we decided to order about 10 pintxos, the choice of the chef knowing that my friend was lactose intolerant. We had great recomandation of wine. And everything was perfect
One of my favorite thing to eat is the morcilla. 
And what i eat everytime is the chocolate creme brule with a glass of Dulce. Please try it!!!","2013-03-23","0","0HJvV5cLxSN5uDgZUBtgBA","4FuQIzsR86C9yAB_O1hpuA"

The coffee comes from American independent roasters and the beans are selected by one person, which gives it a flavour unique in this city.On an off-note, the place needs sandwiches, though, so if you go, bother the staff about that.","2013-08-18","0","PV_0dG4bYgFyrBxgauBWIw","VHekB_oJN8JKi3VbEs37Kg"

"In Montreal for a week, was torn between this place and Schwartz's and SO glad I went here! Had the smoked meat and roast beef sandwich combo with fries, coleslaw, and pickle, and tried my sister's latkes, borscht, and grilled cheese - everything was DELICIOUS, the employees were incredibly friendly and accommodating, and we got to sit and enjoy our meal (not an option at schwartz's gauging from the line and crowd inside).

65$ might seem a bit stiff but you get countless (I really could not keep trAck) tapas, all tastier than the last one
My fav was the grilled octopus a la plancha, and the desert plate (even though by then we re already full)
Definitely to try if you d rather go for 1nuce night out instead of 2meh restaurants
The waitress was also super nice, and on top of everything, efficient yet leaving us time to eat
We showed up early, but by 9 on a weeknight the place was quite full.

it is a well geased crew working the floor.
The meat was good. Not great. The fries were very great. But most of all I loved the complimentary Cole slaw.

Calamari was different in that while it was fried it was a very light batter... It was ok, kinda chewy

"This place is definitely a must try if you like steak. I recommend the Rib steak, medium rare with the twice baked potato. It's basically a stuffed baked potato that has chives bacon and sour cream mashed into it. The best part of the steak was the seasoning. Even if you are a purist I think you should give this one a try! It works! Only thing I think they can improve on is dessert.

"After reading a lot of good reviews, we went there. We waited 1 h for 3 persons.
1-cajun chicken panini 
the waiter said there is just one half;I was surprised because it was a Sat and still 3 hours until closing
We shared it and but didn't like it that much
2-full cheese panini with caramelized onion and it was better.
3-coffee late.
4-apple muffin which is yummy.

In general it is good but not special i will not return, moreover, a little hard for 3 years old (my daughter) to eat their panini.","2016-10-25","0","46Ld9Qc9nAx_A0jwclNZiw","ptFIlnOVFCPBOStUUXnkmA"

"The food is amazing. The traditional smoked meat is so flavorful and juicy, I dare say it's tastier than Schwartz. The downside is, the service is just as bad as the food is good. At least 3 people of the staff were really unpleasent. Without even asking, you receive your bill while you're still eating. The restaurant was not crowded, and both times I went we received the bill without beeing offered something else. I find that really unkind. That's why I never got to try any of the desserts :p","2013-09-07","0","CKC0-MOWMqoeWf6s-szl8g","Sun8JYo_aptlrMQNwyN-Dg"

Virgil,  I'll give Ur place a try next time.","2014-11-01","0","GWi2y-m_JhR_qTLqyfcgIw","fiAZB5jSD_JMoq_BZbQoQw"

I was disappointed with the pancake which was soggy than crispy. Bland taste. Bibimbap disappointing, too. Have tried better Bibimbaps than this one.  Price is reasonable. Servers were friendly. But I will not come back. Disappointed with the food and the long wait.","2017-05-29","0","BM3mCDw1EPI5DnUFy15Cqg","6UTtMRFHBB9wFd_XciqUOQ"

"Any of the dumplings with coriander are amazing.  The rest is good too,  but I've stopped trying others on the basis of the aforementioned.   

This place has a lot of potential.  The decor is nice,  but they really need to up the night time ambiance.  Play some thievery corporation styled tunes and dim the lighting.   They have a full bar area,  but nobody will ever sit there until it has a loungier feel.

I found that very unwelcoming and unnecessary of her to say. Other than the horrible customer service, it's in a great location.","2017-09-24","0","PGayr8NWag6hAEWYvYiC0w","pvmoGQGNvXE4sAWZRmfCkQ"

I liked it for it has bigger tables suitable for 6-hour non stop study. Im a latte guy  and they don't serve what I call latte but rather a strong dark roast with a few drips of milk  no choice but to swallow it down with a few brownies though

American men, stop wondering why you can't tip dollars. You can, just not dollar coins.

Appetizer of grilled shrimp. Got 4 small shrimp smothered in salad dressing.

"I came in for lunch and ordered a burger. I was disgusted to see that my bun was mouldy. They over a new burger after everyone else had finished their meals, without asking if I wanted an alternative. I asked to speak with a manager and a dude came over 10 min later. He said, ""Yeah the cook grabbed the wrong bag of buns."" Why there was a bag of mouldy buns in the kitchen anyway was beyond me. He offered to comp my meal which I had 2 bites of and offered no apologies. Brutal and unsanitary.","2013-08-02","0","SyxHyAqVEacDlXC1yEMv0A","JJeDoBdclO-nnbZQSAuvGg"

"1st time here, The Soup was tasty I had the Orange lentil Dahl - at 1:30 PM the service was non existent... i sat at a booth for 5 minutes and waited no one came ... so I went to the counter and ordered, although there was staff and it was not busy.  I even had to ask for a spoon when I got my soup...and I waited while the waitress went to the next table to take their order before bringing me a spoon to eat my soup.... This soup soup is so so.","2017-10-31","0","mpHC4Xf_FFFr0VrENsDwYg","Jtj2jbYVaHjj9McHRuUNDA"

-Once you know which items you like, ask for another paper menu then order another round.
- Before you finish eating the food that is on your table, order another round. Repeat until you're stuffed.","2017-04-10","0","6Pan1LNt_NdkwTcr2-xNUA","pn_flI3EBNugBEYFp9okxQ"

"Thank God for mtl dogs who changed ownership! I brought my lab there when it was owned or ran by Mina Carbone (the girl who allowed a dog to get killed on her watch). Now with new ownership i get to leave my lab there without hesitation at such a reasonable price. The new staff is qualified and patient with my lab and are constantly sending me pics throughout the day as they know i was skeptical about trying this place again. Cleanliness is also impeccable.
Love it!! Thx again Mtl dogs","2017-06-07","0","XzcfpWnJARAMvYAp1SEAuQ","S7HUtzVp_zfI7syp9xOVOw"

We have gotten the worst service!! 2 hours waiting for delivery!! I was told it would be here in 30mins to 1 hour to get the delivery and when I called back after the 2 hour wait I was told that they were very busy and there was nothing they could do. 
Worst restaurant. Save your time and money.","2017-04-22","0","_NLspcdFyR6tMWB62icjTw","AqOzgw9Yl6Bdrfu33tIw5w"

"The food is average - just what you should expect at a chain Italian restaurant. 

The hostesses aren't overly friendly and are certainly not that helpful. 

Another complaint, likely not the servers fault as I believe they are extremely understaffed during peak times, but the service is terribly slow. Glass is always empty - no replacements unless requested - no additional bread unless requested. More staff and better scheduling could alleviate this problem.","2015-08-28","0","cAHTDDHJnFJm4qsXH2hxzw","d46FdLjosZgwK_xKrouEFw"

The washroom is in the basement.  It appears this might be a shared facility. The way there is not the best.

"Having the Tower O Rings

I noted that Yelp lists this company of $$ for the food.  I can tell you the Tower of Rings, one mlkshake (med) and two soft drinks with a burger each in a family of four = $112.00 with local sales tax of 13%.

May be add an extra $.

Update: the table behind us had the manager over.  It appears their order was less than satisfactory.","2014-09-06","1","KW4y7uDGjVfU3ClkEjIGhg","AvecQucBNHJ-HqmpPPzfpg"

"Excellent selection of draft beers. From Guinness to Sapporo to Sleeman. 

Pizza prices range from $10 to $16. They offer the legendary Furious Canucker a triple stacked pizza. If you can down this monster in 35 mins it is free.

I purchased the hind leg (see other Yelper's photos).  Very good and cooked to perfection.  It was similar to Terroni's pizza in Toronto.  Very tasty.","2014-05-08","0","EdV_8IgX3guTEuBSFw_5ZA","AvecQucBNHJ-HqmpPPzfpg"

"The appetizers are good but come with only three strips of bread.  A bit of an odd number if you want to share with your table of 4. 

The Ontario pork was very good.  The meat was very smokey.  The Erie pike was tasty.  The steak frites were a bit over done and as the pork took longer the steak was colder. 

The chocolate mousse was very good as was the strawberry shortcake.  The sorbet was very tart.

The only thing is I did find the use of salt a bit much on some things.","2014-11-22","0","aqwxUo9ckQLPPuhXMiATYw","AvecQucBNHJ-HqmpPPzfpg"

"I passed by this place many times but the outside of the restaurant never caught my attention until I discovered this place has a good rating on yelp. Not having much of an expectation,  I was wowed when I walked in.  The decor was glamorous for a restaurant located in a smaller Plaza. It's my first time in a buffet & I am wowed by the quality.  It definitely set a pretty high standard.  I'd give it 4 stars but deducting one cus I had ring of fire right when I came home. But I'd still go back.","2013-09-02","0","YAdyu9ovEiOZXBWkD0H8-Q","oXvYpri1ofscaiEqmCjknA"

The only good thing I enjoyed was the patio. Only decent patio + sushi in that block.  We ordered a decent amount of food for 4 people and requested for more soup and salad cus it only came in one.  They were charging us additional 2$ per soup\/salad when it's free in every other Japanese restaurant. What. The. F.","2013-09-12","0","QePLHlU8MFaU2Sf9dzoLTg","oXvYpri1ofscaiEqmCjknA"

"Came here for Father's Day with my parents and bf. we were served very quickly! The calamari appetizer was really good, I had the bacon cheddar burger with fries,it was yummy and filling. Dad got the bison meatloaf, my bf had the big wing sandwich and that was big and really tasty! My mom got the turkey and goat cheese sandwich and she was very happy. Great place to go for lunch or dinner! Reasonable priced as well. Will go back again soon!","2013-06-18","0","sC9tVs1kwnTGFWrhHr_1GA","hBUupeMO4-AHK9Kn9qDU2Q"
"I came here with my parents for Mother's Day and I was surprised to see the restaurant almost empty. We were seated right away and given menus. We ordered the sampler appetizer that had calamari, ribs, and crab&cod cakes.. Super filling and tasted really yummy. good for 2-4 ppl. I ordered the French onion soup, seafood linguini, and baileys cheesecake for dessert. Big portions too, and you get a relish tray and garlic bread to snack on. I would deffinetly come here again! great food! Try it out!","2013-05-13","0","OEFDnarfWI8sFGTFgax7pA","hBUupeMO4-AHK9Kn9qDU2Q"
