"Bad service. Went there yesterday and the waitress asked what we wanna drink and we asked for tap water. Then we ordered 3 combos which supposed to come with soup, main course and drink. After we finished, we forgot about the drink and the waitress didn't ask again. I call back after, she said ""I asked at the beginning already (Yea, before we ordered ???). And it's over, it's too late and we won't give it back to you"". Com'on, I didn't even ask for it. And why she has to be so rude?","2013-06-20","0","FY514Cg0qUfBcKjNVSEf-w","8UeZlkMM7_VD1UtM9bZjTg"
