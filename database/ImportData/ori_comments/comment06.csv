"Came right on time for happy hour (3-9pm). Chips and dip were served as soon as we hit the table and they were DELICIOUS! The service was great and very quick. 

I had a fajita quesadilla which was pretty good very big size for an appetizer, but could have included a little more steak for the price.

Although service was prompt and very friendly there was nothing spectacular about the experience but I would still come again.","2014-02-28","0","krAgdtJ-2CcNGpuwKCbt9A","eik0fCG0ERBup-G-iJPVqw"

"$35 for all you can eat buffet. They take reservations ahead of time and the reservation remains valid until the game ends. Your best deal would be to buy super cheap tickets and then come here.

"Brought in a coupon for a free 6"" sub with the purchase of one of equal or greater value. I decided to get a footlong for me and the six inch for my son. I feel totally ripped off. They said in order to use the coupon they would have to ring it in as 3 separate six inch subs because the computer wouldn't recognize the coupon with a footlong. So in the end I ended up paying more for the 2 six inch sandwiches than I would have if I had just paid for my footlong and a six inch.

I waited a long time so I clearly wasn't needy. I got one call from a private number with no voicemail at 10:22. So I call back and ask for an ETA on food and she yells over my question of ETA aggressively and cussed me out:( I just wanted pizza.

5. Noise cancelling headphones - keeps your beat up

Our waiter want attentive didn't even offer is any chips & Salsa, we had you ask another waiter. The party was different their service was just the oppositethey were on top of things.

"Those big metal urns of coffee are cool.  Seriously, no more waiting for a single pot of coffee to be brewed cuz they have 8 huge urns.  Two regular, a Cinnamon, probably one decaf and the rest of their usual flavors.  They also have a hot beverage machine that pours Hot Chocolate plus three other type of hot beverages.  Rewards gets you One free after you've purchased Ten.  That's alright.  Bring in your own cup and it costs ya just over a buck for a cup of coffee.

"Anyone looking for authentic Salvadoreño, who doesn't have the grandmother I do to make them pupusas and tamales, this is the spot to go. I've eaten many pupusas all my life, I am Salvadoran, and I can honestly say that el Guanaquito is quality.

Do not let the exterior of the place fool you, it looks a bit sketchy but the food will not let you down. First timers have to try these things, pupusas revueltas, tamales de pollo and for a drink, horchata or ensalada.","2013-08-11","0","R1k-z3Mauqk4v-7ZeEVsHQ","SoL4ToJdvxWpGGzxYVA86A"

"High grade Mexican burritos and tacos; a bit pricey, however. Their almond horchata is good, but quite expensive and insufficient in quantity. 

The ambience features the same annoying, insipid, and dumb hipster music featured at other joints akin to this. This is unsurprising given that it's frequented by hipsters; you know: tattoos, piercings, ""tolerance"", and supporting every other Hollywood inspired nonsense and destructive agenda.
I digress. Foods quite good, but bring shades and ear plugs.","2014-03-23","0","AhPmh0NaRDbEYyhd9egzLA","UUFlYsoKWKSvBtUWUAg3Jg"

He insisted it was fine. Didn't offer to fix it & told me it was supposed to smell like that. Still charged us for the roll.  My son & I quit eating it. I was very irritated at the lack of customer service & food safety. My son & I both got really sick after this meal.

"The bartender acted like she had better places to be. I tried to keep my sunny disposition but it was a challenge. The cocktail waitress was a lot friendlier until we had a mixup about my order. That put me on her bad side quickly, but she eventually warmed  back up--a little.

The food was salty for some items & dry for others. I will happily spend money for good food. However $100+ for mediocre chicken wings? I can think of much better ways to blow my money.","2015-12-10","0","KFAJsmQ6GnHxyfmv16s9VA","wzCmGYsfmT-gLLIan9aIfA"

"This is the best church in the valley! Bishop Thomas makes Scripture easy to understand. He's a natural comedian and keeps services interesting! It is on the larger side...there are well over 4, 000 members. There is an East Valley location in addition to this location. The Phx location has 2 levels to accommodate all of the people. I began going here over 10 years ago. This was the 1st church that made me want to keep coming back! I'd highly recommend it to everyone!

"The selection of items and service are good. I come in here a lot because it's close to my house. But, they seem to have a bigger, better selection, as well as, customer service at the Ross on 48th St & Ray Rd-Ahwatukee. Also, I don't have people walking by me watching me as if I am stealing. Lol I just like to take my time and I can be horrible on making decisions. I guess I can see how that could come off as suspicious but I still don't like it! I'd give them 2.5 stars out of 5.

In addition to these they have a full convenient store. My only issue was that the car wash attendant kept trying to up sell me on other things. I was already getting the Ultimate Plus which was $32.99. They did a nice job on my car. I must say better than most other places I've been to.

See giraffe.. $5 per person. Ride a train...$8 per person. It is horrible!! The animal areas are so far in distance you simply cannot see Anything u less you pay per person to get close. A better local choice is wildlife zoo or out of Africa. Both have trains and you can feed animals once inside.","2014-03-26","0","7RTwUpuPFnIHPoTmWJpWhQ","uPHLHOZ52a5Rrz3N_RrvxA"

When I go to place my order the system clears out my zip code and then my transaction is subsequently denied due to an AVS mismatch, but it winds up getting approved and credited on my credit card.
