"Pamela's has some really good food, but the coffee is awful. Been that way for years.   This is true at all Pamela's locations. The staff know that too. Sometimes the wait staff would let customers smuggle in coffee from the Coffee Tree across the street. Since this has been true for so long 
I doubt it will ever change. Hot tea is your best option.","2017-06-13","0","b_xFN9mtFWHUbny-GoiErQ","tg7rDyiw2QJO9yZDuFNshQ"

I went there for ""colorful stuff"" to fill an inflatable sculpture with and this place had just what i needed. I also got 6 pairs of earrings because they're fun and quirky and only $2 ! They have a really nice fabric selection. When you buy in bulk you can fill a bag with whatever you want from that section so i got a ton of pens-- including microns!","2016-07-17","0","K34wQG_chxynxWSGNYI5QQ","RAe03ecUZBg3jYbN55u5RA"

Food over cooked and no flavor including wings.Called to let them know I was upset since being a long time supporter and manager at the time said there was nothing she could do since she did not see the food . I wasn't requesting a refund but at least acknowledge the CUSTOMER. Told her will not be ordering from them again and she said ""oh well"" load of crap. I know I will never recommend this restaurant again!!!!","2013-09-04","0","1ylA7yyrMMUX1zcu5EqO4Q","FEbt4jvpT6O9T_ktaIaOQw"

"I was actually shocked to read everybody's great reviews for this place. Although I do appreciate the generous amount of toppings on the pizza, I did not care for the fact that there was a puddle of water and grease in the middle of my pizza. the crust was not cooked in the middle and the pizza was warm at best after a five minute drive to my house. The breadsticks were nothing but rolled up dough with garlic on top. I don't feel a one-and-a-half topping pizza with bread sticks was worth $33.","2013-08-03","0","AD9b2W2gPZlD8AQHkBIl7w","eNWeP3wU94Mp6jcRFD5ipA"

"If they don't have your pet's food on the shelf, ask if they have it in stock in the back. If they don't have the size you want in stock at all, ask if they will price match a number of the smaller bags to the size of the bag you want. For example, they price matched three of the 5 lb bags of dog food to the one 15 lb bag that I wanted but they didn't have in stock. Normally the 5lb bags are $12.99 each and the 15 lb bag is $24.99. So with the price match I got three 5 lb bags for $24.99.","2015-05-22","0","7Oht41Pn7Knb46BRFR1FpA","yiKkxcuQdB04PVUW7OgtNw"

"Something is very fishy. When either the Power ball or Megan Millions gets high, my wife will buy a couple of tickets. This morning she asked me to check her Megan Millions ticket. On one she had matched 3 which when I checked, was a $5 payout. She came out of the store and announced she has won $1. Told her someone was wrong. This time I went into the store and the clerk said there was nothing she could do. What is this ... a new way to maximize profits?","2016-06-26","0","VyxaxOrPvCSWAXrXve9y7A","GGTF7hnQi6D5W77_qiKlqg"

"We have been dining here for years.  We noticed that the food has become consistently worse.  The menu hasn't been updated in years.  We are so disappointed in the food and service.  If not for the harbor view, this place would have gone out of business long ago.  Awful.
A place for drinks.  That's it.  We left tonight and went somewhere else for food after sending back my dinner twice!!  Yuck.","2017-07-31","0","baVeDut9bOYwXef7CVgN2w","R8-c-IZ2VAACEM-xAJuMsQ"

"My apologizes not reviewing the amazing food, the starter was yummy I had the oysters although I wasn't expecting them to be fried. and MY salad was amazingly delicious but my husband unfortunately didn't like his wedge salad only due to it seemed like his was missing what a lot of other plate had on there's such as croutons, cucumbers, etc and all he got was the wedge and dressing literally. anyway the dinner was remarkable for us both! and dessert as well it was an amazing experience.","2016-02-29","0","_ruizXa-KyFO5mNA0p3nBA","GN0Via1A5zVEMUzX6StZTw"

"This is our go to spot any night of the week! Sit at the bar or at a table it won't matter. Food is delish. The ""live music"" is awesome. Ultra Low key and they are excellent! Drinks are great too. Although I think they should ""pretty"" them up a little. If you're having a purple martini it's just prettier with some sort of garnish... The side dishes are meant to be shared. They are all enormous. The desserts are huge and all delish! The waitstaff and bartenders are the best around!","2017-06-08","0","WNr5N1oDX9D9-xPn8U4kRg","JhTrQSwxXxKcUkKXGXuBtg"

"After multiple visits feeling like I was an inconvenience from the moment I walked in the doors, not from the physicians or Dr. kanelos's nurse, but from other staff members, today was very different. My son had two stitches taken out by Mitch Hibbard, and he did an amazing job. His interaction with my son was so sincere. He took his time and everything went so smoothly.  I am very grateful and for this I will continue with this Practice.","2014-09-05","0","M9nSwBxPRxH83wVNYmzmJA","EzL0sjB7wL3W6cuRlkoJMg"

"DON'T BUY FURNITURE HERE! We went to garden ridge for our kitchen table. Found a nice one for around $300. Bought it and realized after buying it that it wouldn't fit in our hatchback car even with our seats laid down, we stated we would come back tomorrow with our truck and they said no, we had to take it then. We brought it home, up to flights of stairs to our apt,  only to find it was missing screws and had to take back the entire thing and they refused to take it back without the box.","2013-03-08","0","Xz3Qj0zZfSxA95ELBwoXjg","fp1DBn7WMjENnYsqAOBJYg"

If you ever have a problem with your furniture, go back to the store!! Do NOT call customer service. They could care less about you.

"Having lived in Peru for two years I'm always on the look out for some authentic cuisine. Tucked away on Elizabeth Avenue, Viva Chicken is definitely worth trying whether you enjoy Peruvian food or aren't sure what to expect. The rotisserie style chicken did not disappoint, and the yucca fries were fantastic! You can get cans of Inca Kola, or a glass of Maracuya (passion fruit juice) or Chicha Morada (a purple corn beverage) to complete your meal. I'll be back for more :)","2014-04-23","0","sdYkVaTy7EJwUkO8Ie_qPg","KhM8lOkI6fP11SObo8T5Zw"

"Testing this place out. Thanks to Groupon. It's good...it resembles a bit of 5 Guys. But - taters, very crispy. Burgers. Enough to clog an artery or two. Ordered mushroom veggie burger. Yum but a bit messy. Marinated mushroom creates a bit of ""grease"". Overall. It's good. Not a wow factor.","2013-04-26","0","mpEHqp7sbqylm6_GHdhlDg","YeAz2sfOeEqhA9YB44BfAQ"

The property is older so the apartments were not built in a month, you can feel the quality of them when you walk in the door and they go above and beyond to accommodate your apartment needs. They are constantly improving the property and renovating the units so you can have all the luxuries of a new apartment without the new apartment rental rates.","2016-03-25","0","NXFzdXIMMf0_c2okynbjKg","QsOPQAUkLP795j1csg0XpA"

"On June 25, 2015 at approximately 1230 pm I was at Mertz Soul Food Restaurant. I ordered 3 piece chicken wing dinner. The order was to go. When I got home I noticed that the chicken had not been cleaned, there were little pieces on feathers of on the edge on the wings. I pulled what I thought to be feather, and it was long blonde hair that cooked into the skin of chicken. Just the sight of me pulling the blonde hair from the chicken cause me to almost vomit.","2015-07-09","0","aO1gAp41n8w8zpxTiHdLNA","0PLXe_gj5FwMTuiYqJnsXw"
