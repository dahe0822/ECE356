"I got sick with the flu and felt like death so my husband looked online and found IV revival. They gave us 10% off and Shelby was at our house within the hour. Didn't have to get out of bed or anything. I was very nauseous so she gave me something for that and I felt sooooo much better after. Was well worth the money and will have a client for life!","2017-04-23","0","Z3QHUXXUq3ek9iJFe5BQew","QIROZJF4poynfttYK1l8jg"

"I started going to this Dr. about a year ago. Right off the bat I found him to be unpersonable.   I had a few procedures done here and every time he and the hygienist staff seemed to be very frustrated and impatient. The Dr. also tries to push product.   When I told them I couldn't afford a procedure that was a few things in one, to break up the cost, I was never responded to.  Overall, if you want a friendlier dentist and less deceptive office, I do not recommend this office.","2016-07-19","0","1hLyowQNFM1tawaA0cmi4g","Ed6O0doyqf3JjdzYGkGTDQ"

I laughed. I had a flight of tequila and enjoyed the sangrita, but the signature margarita with it's salt air was far better. Had a little kick, but it was awesome.

"The fish tacos were good, would have loved a lime and the pork popcorn bites were unique and a nice change from the average popcorn chicken. I was expecting less ""bar"" food, a little more restaurant grade, So if I go back I'll stay away from fried food and try the bbq pork. Hopefully they will recreate their nacho recipe, the cheese is clumped together, but the salsa is good therefore chips and salsa would have been better.","2015-11-13","0","wltfqot_Et0r-DYaZDxWFA","IpXGWrBxF9sriBx5LuuhaQ"

"This was my first and my last trip to Danny's carwash....just wanted to get the express oil change and basic wash on two of my vehicles. The guy that was filling out our service slips was so distracted like he was on drugs. One of my cars sat for 45 minutes after the oil was changed and they never got around to washing it. They washed the other vehicle, changed the oil but tried to over charge us on that. Overall  staff was slow and they try to

I got the gyro pita combo, the meat in the gyro was excellent it was seasoned perfectly, I could taste it in the mean. The portion was perfect size. Everything fused well together.

"The best tip for Yelp is to check all the reviews. Even the ones that are not currently ""recommended"" by Yelp. Yelp has a very bad habit of not ""recommending"" good reviews by actual customers, and ""recommending"" negative reviews from fake yelpers who have never been to the location.

I go in the day before my wedding and they are tiny and brownish (dead basically) and she tried to say they arnt in season. Ok well that's not what you said on the phone!

"THEY SMOKE INSIDE THIS BUSINESS!

Not sure who owns this place but listen to this.

Went to ship a large package and was greeted by the most negative employee. She was highly negative and very reluctant to ship my package. 

She advised that it would be over $100 to ship the package and said she wouldn't get around to it for over an hour in case ""I changed my mind""

The business reeked of smoke! She smokes cigarettes in the business.

The point of going to a bar is to have drinks and after you have a few drinks you begin to get drunk. Unless I am in a altercation don't bother me... I'm spending money and hanging out with friends at a bar.
 Law enforcement? Are you a park ranger? Yelp Cop? If it's illegal to be drunk in a bar where is it legal to be drunk at? And why have I never been kicked out of any other places for being drunk?","2014-03-23","0","_gO1inMQhfXlK_S46SgGJA","ZfHpJyuDoU8HIAWvTwsiUQ"

"This place was horrible! We were sat in a booth at 8 pm yesterday night and our waiter was not enthusiastic. Our water came with our meals. She forgot one of our salads. She ONLY brought one bread basket with 2 breads when we had 3 people and she failed to bring more. She came and asked us how our food was as two of us were chewing and one was choking. When no one replied she asked good? And walked away, as our friend was choking. This experience was terrible","2014-02-08","0","yGMCl0vYigshkXiZFIDTNw","luAf57wzjyWX1lQR6sVinA"
"This experience was terrible enough but since we wanted to celebrate we wanted some desert. After finally getting to the end of our meal, we were expecting a warm invite to dessert but instead the waiter slammed a receipt on our table and said good night. We didn't even have a chance to say we wanted dessert so we had to go to IHOP. We were furious and when we wanted to talk to a manager or a host, no one was around the place was deserted.","2014-02-08","0","yGMCl0vYigshkXiZFIDTNw","luAf57wzjyWX1lQR6sVinA"

"Got the stuffed salmon special last night, it was wrapped in the bottom brown part of the salmon and visually was turned off. The rosato pasta stuff was clumpy and tasted like it was microwaved in a bag. Bruchitta was soggy, not toasted either. The male owner could have cared less and the female owner wearing a bedazzled coat was sitting at a table drinking. Bathroom was gross with a basket of used gold tees for some reason and my wife was stuck in the bathroom cause there was no tp.

"Expect them to be in the back of the store area. By the time they finally come out they'll act bothered by your questions on products. When it comes to check out time they're very dry with conversation. If you return anything they will treat you extremely catty (with receipt). Terrible mannerisms. The older Caucasian woman should not be working there. Two in fact.  A Spanish lady and younger Asian girl that worked there have been nice. The things I've seen in that store. Shameful.","2014-04-04","0","XmBEnJF90Bo7fUEbMiYhqw","1dvxoi-YCF7aKw_Xs23aow"

I've been holding my made food and have to wait for someone to come over and allow me to pay....  Usually after there's a line between the order station and pay station.  More fun with screaming kids on line.","2013-09-20","0","QSCDR9RBTVyTw7p_Nbq1Xg","iFqnpz0qoSJmmu1pw3UwHw"

"I have never had a long wait or slow service.  Staff has always been great and professional.  As i have been to many restaurants, i can compare easily.  If the place is busy, be patient.  If you go out to eat, give them time and relax.  I would rather have time to relax than have someone on me right away.  Unfortunately too many people get in a hurry.  To this, i just say, if anyone is in that much of a hurry, get fast food.  For me, i want Red Lobster.","2016-03-21","0","hSbCSR7F8HAwfoZcm0jpww","g8IQDvFG4cNek0MaIG7mcA"

Rude to a customer walking the lot (infront of me and my wife while he was ""helping"" us) and then became noticeably angry and hostile when I said the numbers he was spewing out on payments weren't making sense. He did mention his uncle owned the Subaru and jeep dealerships so maybe he feels he can act however he wants. If you live in the west valley and want a new Subaru the dealership seems nice but do not deal with spencer.","2016-09-01","0","TxEuAzL8dXy7dhqAKfWZ3Q","lcwL_U6NsKg_4TVbA3MAHQ"

"Worse salon to ever touch my hair. I have platinum blonde hair that was orange and grayish purple after 2.5hrs of being there. The stylist was fairly new in experience. Not one stylist offered to help while watching her color my hair twice with toner over and over. I have relocated here and what a sorry disappointment. This was a horrible experience. I went in willing to spend whatever it took to get my hair done correctly.

I pulled it out and it appeared to be hard black growing mold. management insisted it was a burnt piece of steak, im no food expert but how in the hell does burnt steak get into butter?? I dont know how anyone else feels about this, but I feel they should be visited by a health inspector and I will never eat there again.","2014-05-30","0","NpFtNc51LaZr8Y5_o2wRaw","zn3AdcOkIHyky4M-e1_UjQ"

"Clean friendly , and great coustomer service! My service expert came to me as soon as i pulled up, he recommended other features since my truck just hit the 30,000 mile mark, he recommend and explained all steps along the way! 

Inside the service waiting room they have a TV , comfy seats and other features! 

They have free popcorn, free water bottles and best of all free coffee! 

Also while i waited i walked outside to see the line up of newer models , much variety! 

Great service !","2013-11-09","0","cdJwSJ1tttbxFUfB4FAfCA","-kZ3ZmeUHpLm_-dyZrtI2w"

The spicy candy is good, and last but not least the Raspados are AWSOME, shaved ice with several natural flavors to choose from,  topped off with a sweetened condensed milk called Lechera ! 

I would recommend anytime,

i just dislike that they charge 50 cents extra for every transaction if you use DEBIT\/CREDIT CARD!  

Other than that great !!","2013-08-08","0","RUJymwuG7ICtEZpXLqJpUg","-kZ3ZmeUHpLm_-dyZrtI2w"
"I have purchase three vehicles from this dealership, great experience every time Saul. I even referred multiple friends, they each were given the above and beyond service I had. I have always had the pleasure of dealing with a few of the team members in service, they were all exceptional. This dealership listens to your needs, gives you the prompt service and ensures as their customer you are only happy with purchase but the continued ownership of one of their vehicles.

"I am a vegetarian. If you say vegetarian style, normally they make whatever you want with beans instead of ground beef. Well, this time I ordered vegetarian style the guy just put extra tomatoes. When I bit into my crunch wrap (which you can't see unless you've taken a bite) there was nothing but ground beef and tomatoes on it. I brought it back & the guy told me it was MY fault because he didn't know what vegetarian meant. They offered to make me more food but no refund.

"It's important to give your pharmacist time to fill your prescription. Rush the pharmacist and there could be dire consequences! Narcotic prescriptions always, always take longer to fill. And even though, you may only be filling something that does not need to be counted, i.e. birth control or inhaler, you may be the 10th person in line or there could be issues with insurance that bumps the wait time up. It's never ""just put it in the bag.""
