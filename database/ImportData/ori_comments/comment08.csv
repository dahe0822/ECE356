"I had a long conversation with the owner,  Randy,  today about the history behind the restaurant.  His father was a WWII soldier & he closed his business called Wimpy's Paradise during the war.  When it was all over,  Randy asked his dad if he had any regrets in life. Dad said my only regret was never get a chance to re-open Wimpy's Paradise.  To continue on with the legacy & spirit of his father,  he opens up this restaurant.  What a beautiful story. His father's photo is hung on the wall.","2016-07-31","0","2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw","j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g"

"I love Rolling Rock on tap. Call me odd; But at 50 cents a college plastic cup, combined with very value priced rotisserie chicken, sides, sandwiches and wraps, chargrilled skewers that all taste well above any purchase in its price range (and some very high end places surprisingly), it would be silly to say, ""Honey, I'm tapped, we can't go out tonight."" You and your girl can drink, enjoy young college energy while eating great food and spend 25-30 bucks.

How I've missed it, but no longer!  The roast pork fried rice was really good too. . Not greasy, lots of meat.  I'll definitely be back!

"We love Zupas!!! only 2 things though they could improve

-don't ask if I want croutons etc in my soup for $.65. Just charge more for the soup and have that stuff be complimentary. feel Nickel\/ dimed and would rather just pay more for  soup.

-we order food, go down the line, get to the register and they ask us what our order was.  annoying - get my order from your team and say how much I owe...I don't want to remember every detail from my family's order

Other than that...fantastic!","2017-06-06","0","f64wkzPLEjXIbTJ9eGS6XA","td7WdoHUZk7CLNgd562b1A"

They are pet friendly and charge only $20 per pet...they even gave us a 1st floor room right near an exit which was convenient for taking the dogs potty. Amazing cook to order omelets or eggs, with any other item pre cooked and kept warm. Pretty pool very very clean. We missed the free happy hour but from other reviews it sounds good.

"Was here last week and raved about the half chicken and ahi tuna.  Today we had the spinach and artichoke dip which is always good and I had the ding chicken sandwich.  The slaw on the sandwich overpowers the taste of the chicken which when eaten without the slaw was rather thin and a little dry.  Hillstone Tends To Over salt their fries and this afternoon lunch was no different.   I understand the need to juice their fruit in house but the lemonade is way too tart!","2014-08-12","0","XC06xxb7FFYsXcI2E38IIw","kUADOBnw0dwBx9YRfbQL1w"
"We ordered the grilled artichokes as an appetizer and they are fabulous!   Next time we're ordering two!   The 2 dipping sauces that come with it are very tasty!   Next we split the NY steak sandwich and that was very good served medium!   The service is great and the food arrived very quickly and it was served at the right temperature.  I highly recommend this place as it also has a neighborhood bar that serves great food in Arcadia!","2014-08-09","0","w1S46TdjMdQj-zCZoXPd4Q","kUADOBnw0dwBx9YRfbQL1w"

"This upscale cigar bar is relaxing and offers a nice variety of fine cigars.  My new favorite is Acid Kuba Kuba after having Tatiana cigar for years.   They have a great lounge area with 3 large screen TVs plus WiFi for the working person. The have a bar area that's not too big but it concentrates more on cigars.   They staff is awesome and friendly.   They have a small selection of beers but a good choice of them.

Service was play, had to flag down our serve a few times to get stuff refilled. food taste okay,wasn't as great compare to the other Korean BBQ I been too. Side dishes really lack in taste and it wasn't fresh. Well the bean sprouts, my boyfriend said it was still frozen.

"Considering that it's the Holiday season, i was surprised that we were seated in less than 15 minutes with a last minute reservation called in an hour earlier. Spinning salad is part of the meal, and Lawry's Yorkshire English pudding is to die for...soft, light and hot. Ladies, if this is your first time at Lawry's with your Date, you cant go wrong with the 6 oz.California Cut. The next best one is the 10 oz. Lawry's Cut. 16 oz. Diamond Jim Brady with the boner. I meant, bone-in.","2014-12-27","0","RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA","SINvtxMBnvzsOhvD71haUQ"

"Customer centric employees take pride in helping.  In that case, you won't have to ASK for help.  However, I will say if we take the location into consideration, we might not expect friendly employees and good customer service.  It's in an unsavory neighborhood next to one of the most transient Walmarts in Phoenix.  That goes for most stores around there. (EXCEPT for Home Depot which has excellent customer care!)","2013-09-21","1","mXnSeCVmvTVNQYNCiATQtQ","Y0wYrwBhcdh3yIKgdX3fVQ"

They know about wings and should know better than that,  I asked server to please reheat them at least and they did.  Wings were as warm as should be but,  they did not bring half of the flavors that I had ordered, and that's where wings at native became like a box of chocolates I did not know what I was getting.

Second,  presentation,  bubbling but shredded cheese on top instead of cheese blocks or logs. Third,  taste,  great spice but,  a sweet taste to the dish, should not be sweet.

Overall, the cheeseburger was bland, but they offered to replace it with another menu item, which was nice of them.","2013-04-17","0","yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ","iev9kF-VpBf9BYkPXwNjtQ"

The Savannah Chopped Salad is a favorite as well as the Four Cheese Griller. The spuds are great ( huge) so I get it as the Choose 2 combo with a salad and half a spud and it's a perfect lunch. The service is always good and it's nice to be greeted as a regular. Oh, and the fresh, baked-daily cookies?

"Food was fine ( that's all)
1.We were told there was a 20 minute wait with 4 empty tables. We could sit at the bar but could not order for 20 min because the cook was backed up.
2. Asked and was told the draft beers were $5.00 , when I was finished was told it was actually 7.50. They did not honor their mistake.
3. Very pricey .... the apps cost as much as the entrees .
4. The app arrived the same time as food

"I haven't been in Arizona very long and basically knew no one! I got into financial trouble and needed legal help I went on yelp looking for an attorney and based on reviews  I went with Rosacci Law Firm. 
I was nervous and unsure if the lawyers would basically hold my hand through the bankruptcy process...they gave there word and kept there word.
This whole process went smoothly.
Thank you Victoria, Joyce and Antonio.
Highly recommend Rosacci Law.","2017-12-03","0","R5xIz45ztdsthSKBbgMvCQ","evg8wN3r8-QYyh5mxLz6SQ"

"We used to love this place but it just keeps getting worse.  This time they screwed up our order 3 times. To ""fix"" the smaller sized pizza that they made in error, they refused to remake it and just gave us a small along with the wrong one.  We sat on the kids side and it was filthy.  There was food all over the floor. Not just crumbs but chunks of crust, toppings & celery smashed into the carpet. Napkins are kept in back - very convenient when eating with kids & pizza dripping in grease. Ugh","2013-05-04","0","0Rni7ocMC_Lg2UH0lDeKMQ","dW9WtbAYs_JS2dkbExzNBA"

"Really confused EVERY time I go to this DQ. Unfortunately my daughter loves it and we frequent it once a week by her rewarded choice. We get the same thing EVERY time and it always cost different? Almost always (except for one time) when you order a child's meal it comes with a couple items for desert included in the meal. Check your receipt bc they will charge the additional cost. It's not a big deal, but when they charge different prices it adds up. Today the girl said ""I didn't charge you","2017-06-11","0","-J-d5x84RuyLNiUzOhO_6A","4oAf-ntRqWGLIfZzoQkHRQ"

Bike went in for a tune-up and came out with a flat tire and missing valve stem caps. Not pleased. And I went way out of my way to go there on the advice of a friend.

"Omg do people no know what size there dog it? Here is a tip. Its good to go when less people are around if u just want to get your dog out of the house. If you have a small dog like a chi. Be weary because some people think their rott or pit bull is considered a small dog or idk. But two separate areas clearly marked for large breeds or small and people can't follow rules. It sucks because I have a chi and when big dogs are around he is scared and won't play like he does with the small dogs.","2013-04-11","0","OamYn_r-y4sIiH1WisIqrw","-7k1bbiP_NYUU_yi5zMhzg"

Many moons ago when I first started coming here, the only thing that could be said about this place that was not positive was the beans that they use in their food we're heavy and very pasty. It's been at least a year now that they have fixed that and their beans are outstanding just like the rest of their menu.","2014-02-16","0","jhdrw0UTPtvNbcltt85Lcw","isJUXvHFS0LAttl1AYR8aw"

"Pathetic translation for a restaurant.  People heed to the Yelp stars! Waited 35 min for food, we walked out. The service was so so bad.  The salsa was horrible, tasted like a can of El Pato chile.  The waiter was perspiring and kept wiping his face with hands & touching everything! Disgusting! Hostess were high school rejects lacking customer service.  We never got  passed the chips & salsa.  Thank God we walked out when we did! 
Will never return.  I give it 1 star for diet Pepsi.","2013-07-23","0","JfHXzulF6yIKgA22YYPedw","PFsuO3wLU1CuYiHmJiRVmA"

"Don't let him talk you out of getting an MRI. first of all chiropractors should never go against your doctors medical advise. That's unethical. And secondly an MRI has no radiation and is an amazing diagnostic tool and it's absurd to find someone who is so against them.

"Advice to Mgmt: Train your staff on customer service. So much of your staff goes in and out from the back with out asking who has been helped and who hasn't. They need to be aware of who they've helped and who hasn't. If someone has been standing there after 15 min and not gotten their order, ask them what their order is and go check on it. It's not hard.   Last Thanksgiving, you had a great system in place. But Christmas Eve service was a let down.","2015-12-24","0","q2KtxnPa6rPSpAlMbg9l8g","40hSkIN9SoRVqaQvbpFNgQ"

Staff was helpful and friendly, store is clean and best of all we discovered a new kind of bread that we are think is delicious. I think it's their Iraqi bread and it's made fresh in store.

"Basically this is the way it goes. Never heard of this place until my husband worked here for three years. He was let go yesterday. He was great at diagnosing as the other tech isn't. The owner mark lost his other store in temp,pretty soon this one will go down too. People you're over paying for shit jobs. Were here picking up my husbands stuff, the owner is here and can't even say a simple hello and how are you to someone who worked for you for three years. Sad. Terrible to work for that.seeya","2013-09-25","0","G-w4z0nYnLcYwQYXMbEb5w","lKRXUrIRYTgCjN-ymt99-g"

"Sugarloaf has a puppy package to help ""save money"" but I have spent around 450$ on vaccines and a microchip. I started searching around other vets when it came time to neuter my dog because sugarloaf said it would be another 450$ to do so and 350$ to have his dewclaws removed. I've found a lot of other places with vaccine packages ranging from 60 to 100$ and neutering from 50 to 75$ This place is out for money. Do not suggest it.","2016-01-04","0","yoZtvhQGbZDd0FYQhcbp5g","6UyU5InMtHnX_Pci6B3TIQ"

"Extremely disappointing experience.  Received a direct mail invitation to their Grand Opening, which offered a free item of equal or lesser value thru April 30th.  Ordered two Genghis Khan salads for take out.  We expected them to both be the same. Their offer was a blatant scam, since they put 10 shrimp in one salad and only 4 in the other or maybe their offer of a free item of lesser value was what they meant literally.  In any event, the shrimp were terrible so we threw them in the garbage","2017-04-24","0","5zHi8eQhO7sO3N15zHgkUg","5qgtsemhZ0dEJJdmjoX2SQ"
