"Just came here and ordered 2 California burritos and 4 tacos for the family. When I got my food I had a lot of grizzle in both burritos and taco meat was not  fresh at all. I use to love coming to this place as the owner and lady behind the counter were very nice in the beginning.  They acted all confused with my order. I think I'm moving on to a better taco joint. Service and quality went down hill and thats after I gave them the benefit of doubt I get shitty quality burritos and dry tacos","2014-02-24","0","yUfT6GtCII9g4lg-9olksw","uJeK3DSxfnm39cFRJvqtbQ"

"Everyone was personable and understanding. I was nervous at first, but the warmth from the staff and the doctor put me at ease knowing our little girl was in good hands. Given some posts I read beforehand, I felt compelled, a week after her surgery and a full and swift recovery, to sing their praises. They are obviously very good at what they do, evidenced by Pepper's barely-noticeable incision that's healed clean and smoothly.

"DO NOT use this doctor.  Vegas is too full of eye doctors to put up with this one. It's all about the DOLLAR, period. I contacted my insurance company after I left to verify what I already knew  (that my deductible had been met), and sure enough, they didn't bother checking. I sat there and waited while filling out paperwork, only to have them refuse to see me until I paid them 250 dollars up front.

"Came here for lunch & it was worth the wait. It took a little bit to get my order but that's because the pupusas are hand made from scratch. The food was great, very authentic. The pupusas are pretty big. Bigger than others I've had before.  So don't order more than 2. Lol. I made the mistake of ordering 3 pupusas & 2 tacos. But other than the fully to capacity belly the service was great, the food was great & the price was very reasonable.

"Wow, where do I start!! 

Before coining here I checked out the reviews and decided to had to try the chicken pot stickers and they did not disappoint! They were awesome (what can I say I grow up in the 80's). These things are great, great favor, the dipping hot sauce is great, gives it just the right amount of kick. 

I also ordered the wagyu beef sliders. They were Awesome!! Cooked perfect, the beef with the Hawaiian roll was great. I don't care for the shoe string fry's.","2014-01-23","0","IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q","j174CfPPlXhIL27MrZYFnw"

His prices are great, got a transmission oil change, other repair shops quoted me over $800, paid $425.78 out the door, included parts and labor.

"We ordered 2 sandwiches combos. We were told that we would have to wait at least 10 minutes.  I paid $18.99. I never received a receipt.  I thought that was strange. Then, we drove around and wait well over the 10 minutes for the food. As we are leaving, they began locking the doors. KFC doesn't usually close at this time.  So I called them at 9:55 and told them about the mistake. I was told that I recieved the correct sandwich and there was nothing they could do. That they were closed.","2014-08-07","0","862VnRc1IJXoh_CmeIitCw","6Uan0Vj6h3YRPJVqQcraDQ"

Went to Harrahs, Asian girl rolled her eyes while talking to us, just had a very poor demeanor and directed us to the Linq since she had technical issues and won't be able to assist, was then assisted by Ashley and also had a very poor demeanor, I felt bad for having my family members witnessing these two very poor customer service that I kept apologizing.

"I've had a lot of barbecue in my life this has to be in the top three of the worst I have ever had. I would not recommend this place the service was terrible the food was not good the hot links where deep fried and over cook.

So when someone asked me what is your favorite food there I am not being a smart ass but I always say everything I've had because it's all good.

"I went here after talking to a coworker about how much I hate getting my haircut and that it ends up getting ridiculously long (was at the time) and she told me to go see Regina. So I went, expecting the usual; not getting the cut I wanted. 

Let me tell you. I have never been so happy with a haircut before. I even went back to get cleaned up because some spots were still bothering me, and she didn't even charge me. 

New spot. Definitely.","2013-06-20","0","yo32EEhY6N3iC3ZNqCm07A","sNxhoIvKgkq72y1D8ZFnbA"

You will not find someone better than her! I'm already booked for my next facial and can't wait.","2013-08-07","0","Fst6_M69Dghjh2iXGHFX-Q","2s-j9qjA4WK0T2wKhfHj7w"

They do have a loyalty card which helps :) I am so pleased with how great my skin looks. I always get complements and wear less makeup.

"I was riding my mtn bike on Blue Diamond and got hit and run from behind by a vehicle.   I was transported to Sunrise hospital.  Dr Blum came in that night and removed half my skull because of internal bleeding to get rid of swelling.   Dr Blum was very professional and kept me happy.  A month  1\/2 later he put my skull back in.  I'm very happy with the work he did.   Now I'm on the road to recovery.   I appreciate everything he and Sunrise did (possibly saving my life)...

Someone used a CC skimmer to get all my info and tried to buy a bunch of crap online and send money through Western Union to New Jersey.  Humm,  our waiter was the only one whom I gave it to.  Be careful using CC's here, setup monitoring alerts if you do use one.  Thanks to my CC company it was reported as real fraud from here and I didn't pay a dime.","2011-10-22","0","qmymSqVwHYRqdwfcBatzpQ","LOONUX6HVC6mGUw5LZtqEA"

"My nose piece on my very expensive glasses has been broken for a while. I took it in several time to fix. Finally they say they need to get a new piece from the company(sama), so they call me when it comes in. Couple weeks later I call back to check on it and they say that the company(sama) sent the wrong piece so they have to call them again. No call yet. So I'm still waiting for the right piece to come in now two months total and still no courtesy call or update.

"DO NOT BRING YOUR DOG HERE. We've used their vet services which were fine. My main complaint is about how my dog was treated when he was boarded there. We picked up our dog and he was covered in shit and piss. 

I returned to the hospital later on, and watched the staff take the animals out to go to the bathroom. Each animal was only out for about 60-90 SECONDS! SAD.The girls up front lied to us and said they are taken out for 10-15 min 5 times a day.
