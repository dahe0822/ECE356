"Most of our food was undercooked, and one lady was forcing us to pay before we had even finished the meal because their cash desk was closing. They also messed up our orders - brought us stuff we didn't order, didn't bring us stuff that we did order, and brought us the wrong amounts.

Our server apologised, saying that the kitchen staff wanted to go home.

"I had two instructors from here and another one from pioneer driving school. The first one from here was bad, which was from calling the school directly. Second one was great from here and was referred from my friend who passed his g2 in one shot. Abdul (nickname Mir) is very patient and made parking easy! His number is 416 828 3010. I passed my G2 from taking a couple lessons from him! Much better than the instructors I had in the past.","2013-05-28","0","LyxpBXdYcmYSh-ihVqIEbg","IhjiCSCiaefHE-4FAvSOkA"

I thought this place might be a cool find since it's run by italians and has been around for such a long time.

"The congee, fried tunip cake, and fried rice with salted fish were all very good. However, the combination fried rice was just average. The restaurant was nice and clean, but there was long waiting line. As some other reviewers pointed out, there was not much room to sit while waiting, so we had to sit and wait on the curb outside the restaurant .","2013-08-06","0","RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw","8yvyauaA2RTo4lVUUAEW_A"

"Ssam"" means wrapped and usually in Korean dishes it's with a leafy vegetable. When you come here you should try putting the cooked piece of meat on the lettuce and add whatever you want in it then wrap it up and dip it then eat it!!! 

I usually add pork belly dipped in red pepper paste, whole clove of garlic (which I put on the grill to cook a bit), rice and kimchi (which I also put on the grill to cook a bit) then I wrap it and dip it in more sauce and eat! Delicious!","2017-07-20","0","yhDAzBBjFujZbHwBPfE2eQ","ealGXhXMnYhzkBQ_PzbrSA"

I would love to see some truly high end shops come here in addition to pink tartan and brooks brothers.

I'm not sure when dogs were allowed into the mall, but I think its an accident waiting to happen. As it stands I don't want to sit in the sidewalk restaurants anymore... Some of the dogs are taller than the 'fences'","2013-08-18","0","mAaIW-oPVBj_a2RJ-ZtevA","ihpAyKFihU2ddV2vAnetHA"

We got seated and waited about 10mins for our waiter, which was fine because it was busy.  We ordered and the food came within 15mins. The service was great, we were asked if everything was okay and filled our glasses of water. I would come back to this place again.","2017-10-28","0","Mksyt1TZQ-7vzCZjeuzfAg","93YTvNTN6hKg99RAyrRbQw"

"-Service; fluctuates depending on who does your nails. Some give amazing massages or use hot stones on legs after a foot spa. Others are very rushed, in every way. 

-Ambiance; It is not a very relaxing or spa like experience. It can be loud from the hair dryers and constant chatter from staff. Visual clutter everywhere, ie staff Tim hortons cups, purses, and food containers are mixed along the shelving in plain sight as you receive you're manicure.","2015-07-12","0","YMWH70xsOi_rcui8qza3qg","0JaDG6Ggj4uhRwh-rxkqXw"

"Horrible time! First time I felt like I was abandoned by the hair stylist. I went in for an appointment to get color set in my hair all was good until I had to wait more then the 40 mins for toner to set while she went to do someone else's hair. 40 mins later she got another girl to rinse out my hair only to leave me to blow dry it myself. I've never been to a salon that makes you blow dry your own hair! The staff seemed overall friendly but lacking so much professionalism.

"To the owners. I waited 40 minutes to get inside. Payed $20.00 to get in. Then I get in to find out their is a line up to get to the patio!!! Are you crazy. I was waiting 30 minutes again and they were only picking girls to go up stairs. This is ridiculou. Never go back. Suck sucks. I felt that I was treated like an animal. Their is lots if patios an clubs in Toronto that organize better than this. Zero stars. Morons!!!!!!","2013-07-07","0","Vwv0Db2gvyvQsM_1FkSDPA","uF-BetX1uY2joni6BH1O8g"

"Lunar cheesecake (original) is good. It's more like a mousse cake version rather than cheesecake. But after I had one bite it's hard to stop proving it's actually good. 

I personally like the original cheesecake better. And it's more economical to take out\/share a whole round cake with friends rather than just buying a piece which is a bit pricy. 

The whole lunar cake is $18 after tax and one piece (around 1\/4 or less) is over $7 before tax.","2016-06-30","0","6xowh_GdOsRrz9QWN6nMxA","kKnHdlV_nVkPnzNn5NguDg"

Walk home confident in the knowledge the cooling off period will benefit the flavour. It's great that this place cooks their food so hot but I find dining in can be a teeny bit underwhelming as the rashers are so hot for so long it's hard to properly taste them.

Their rolls are so small, it's a joke because I've never seen such terrible rolls. They also look like they are gonna fall apart any moment !  Even cheap all you can eat buffet does better than it.

Except the meat was much more tender than anything I ever had in France and the frites were thin and crispy.

Patio is nice for what it is but avoid sitting there on garbage night I'd you're going to order food.  Although the waitress wasn't super friendly the manager guy who greeted us was very funny and welcoming so bonus points there. Good selection on their snack menu for 5$!","2014-07-09","0","Egn5h9fStvVKcFH7kaLQig","FUDyK8Ga1cimq8XvpgMpBQ"
"A doorman wouldn't let my 35 year old husband in as he had no ID. I had mine that showed I am 31, but he still wouldn't budge and was rude. Common sense wouldn't go a miss when you're running a business. We then walked straight across the road to one of its rival bars and had no problem. Definitely won't be back to O'Grady's.","2015-07-31","0","qXk2CS1-6jKTKpMUIgN9kQ","pivG5Kp8WdoCekuM6bAjGw"

Wings used to be huge but over the last few visits, we noticed a fewer amount of wings (used to be approx 10 lrg\/lb and it is now 6-8)  but assumed it was due to weight.

Very unacceptable. At the end, not only did the manager not accept any concessions, but she was quite angry with my phone call and said ""don't order from us again.""  Very rude and unprofessional. We will not order food from them again and I would advise all to avoid this restaurant.","2017-08-25","0","2Y-28XrkMeeA4FFvv_73tw","Q8rW3FuFjkM3QSlGYUJ9TA"

But I was surprised when they asked me what can I get you to drink ? They have chocolates, candies,smoothies all for free.
It's busy store but lots of things to enjoy the time. Also they have so many styles that I can try on my nails. 
I highly recommend this place.

"We have been big fans of this place for years and last night added to our love for C&D. In spite of the 'no reservations' on wing nights they helped us with tips on timing so we could get all 10 of us seated together. We introduced a number of Newbies to their wings and all bar one have voted them their new faves. We are only back from Aussie for 12 nights & this is on our 'must eat' places. Thanks again to the fab staff for ensuring we had friendly service and all the beers and wings we needed.","2016-10-26","0","x8UvTkKx9WApRsMxQ3ZPtQ","qIQ6yxhGOm5broI8eec5lg"

The noodle only came with 4 or 5 very very thinly sliced beef, a teaspoon of picked vegetables, some bean sprouts and one leaf of book choy. The noodles were too soft for my liking also the soup didn't have much flavor. I had to ask for hot sauce and I heard others doing the same.

The fried chicken is not southern style, it's more like a gourmet version of southern style. Delicious and tender with really crispy skin but not your typical regular southern fried chicken. As delicious as the food is, the portions are small.

Thank god I had a scarf to wrap myself with. 
I ordered the BBQ salmon on the menu and my bf ordered steak & fries.
Fries were beyond salty had to drink 2L of water when I reached home.The steak was def not fresh and was served very cold.

As per the menu (and the dish itself), it comes with garlic aioli dip - which for me is what I happened to be craving. Dish came - no garlic aioli. Once the server came back around, we asked her for some. She looked puzzled - went to the kitchen and returned a minute later and told us there was none but the cook could ""make some"" but that my ""steak would get cold waiting"".

Really cheap beer; tall can of Pilsner 4.50 (cf. nearby Bambi's, at which I think they're 6.50). Also have a stage.

"I had a terrible experience at this Shoppers today and I will never return. Cosmetics sales rep ""Kim"" I believe her name was working on Oct 01, 13 at 3:24 treated me very unfairly. At first she failed to aknowledge me when she had one other customer in her section. Shortly after I placed my purchases on her cosmetic counter and patiently waited for her to finish with her customer.  She proceeded to ignore me and rang someone else up before me when I was there first. How rude!","2013-10-01","0","DnePvvh3fzo0oH8GB2ChUQ","o6vZIPv0iigpSJtuRSXBPQ"

"Stacey Pollak, is Toronto's best kept secret for getting juicy, butter blond highlights. My hair was transformed to look rich but not brassy and natural looking with just enough buzz that makes you feel glam. Her highlights made my hair even healthier than when I first came in 3 yrs ago. It now looks more full, shiny and luscious and I get compliments on it even two months from when I get it done.

Never did make sense to me so recently before the news I entered fir a contest using all my points.  There was still time to have the contest and choose the winner.","2017-03-05","0","fEn2IwdSrejzHebfUzWDMg","RI-tf9iGOux81GjnB5Qt_Q"
"I usually divide the large stew chicken and large oxtail into two portions when I get it from Albert's but at Mitzie's,  although the food is ok,  the large portions are very little for their price.  I don't go there all the time.  Once in a while when I don't have time to cook.  Ritz is the same. Very skimpy portions. Might as well just get a small but their small will be tiny. :)","2016-12-14","0","W3K_5U2KEw0gxK7cvuB2mw","RI-tf9iGOux81GjnB5Qt_Q"
"Went there to buy a stem for my bike. Components and bikes are overpriced. Customer service is lousy. A simple hello would suffice. Asked for ceramic grease for my rear hub and the guy laughed at me. Never going there again. The kingston location is friendlier but busy.

They are out of ramen? They are out of rice? The waitress could not give me a straight answer and apparently the owner was in the washroom or something. I've always defended this place and loved it, but this really annoyed me. It seemed like they were just trying to get me to pay full price.","2016-03-15","0","EzC51yOetmrju2DPP72iRA","xR8prW7h0ZvtE_PCwPqKBw"

We had half of our orders done incorrectly, but when you explain it to the servers slowly they will understand.

And they had a special: a pitcher of beer plus nachos for 20-something dollars. The last time I was at this bar, I was a 20-something.

"Don't order the fish tacos from the lunch menu. The fish was literally frozen breaded fish sticks and the taco shells looked like those ones from a taco kit at No Frills.

"Such an amazing restaurant! Food and service both spectacular! My friend has been going here for 20 years now and said she has never had a bad experience. I had the pasta with chicken, mushrooms and shrimp...they custom made it in a cream sauce. So accommodating. Complimentary bruschetta and the most delicious fresh baked bread I have ever had in a restaurant. The tiramisu was out of this world...better than I have had in Italy. I will definitely go back!!!! Highly recommend this place.","2014-05-10","0","OJ6zfenoK-eBNI7vvNrOsg","kHeslJGGGqJjA30mifRsVQ"
"Well --- we loved the place so much last time that we returned again !!  Once again we had the greatest server PAUL and his sidekick FRANK.  They treated us like royalty.    I have noticed that everyone I this restaurant is treated as though they are important regulars.   How wonderful.  All employees we have seen work as a big family and include you as a part of it.  The manager is on top of everything and most pleasant.  
My wife had the lasagna special (wow) and I had the saltimbocca(wow ) GO","2016-10-03","0","OJ6zfenoK-eBNI7vvNrOsg","yqaUqLaL_uvJs1PHATFMfw"

Quite spacious seating n the view of downtown out the windows is bustling all time.
Okey now lets talk food i ordered some combo of chicken, ribs, beef . So juicy , so tender n flavoured that I couldn't stop eating. My cousin got steak n i would say it was one of the best ones. 
Wasn't impressed much by the cocktails so go ahead with  instead

"Every time I've been here, the service has been HORRIBLE. Yesterday I waited for a half hour on the patio before anyone even brought us MENUS. I ended up going into the bar to order a round of drinks myself. After we finally got menus, it was another half hour of pestering the overworked and understaffed waitresses for service before anyone even took our order. Add another half hour to that, and they only brought out three of the four (simple) dishes we ordered. Awful, over priced, waste of time","2013-05-21","0","0hudPyuCBlKg79OwKBw-eQ","VamOFXYsxeRE33q42mKv9g"

"First time trying Tibetan food. Had the beef alu pingshu with fried bread. Beef curry stew, with glass noodles, potatoes, and sliced black mushrooms. Awesome! You get a choice of bread or rice. Get the bread!  you'll get two large frisbee sized ovals of fried bread to dip in to the curry. It's a big serving; eat half in, and buy extra bread and take home for a second meal.","2015-09-06","0","J5Uz9eK9qHfxxhT_4ktZGA","bQ_g-GhEooKpvojAPyyXMg"

"Everything was great until they brought the bill.  First they forgot to apply our coupon for ""up to $20 off"" then when they did, they only gave us $16 off because one of the 4 entrée's was less than $20.  Even though we had 2 meals over $20 the waitress AND manager argued with us and gave us MAJOR attitude.   Finally we had them split the bill to have the 2 entrees over $20 on one bill for them to give us the proper discount.  It's not the $4, it's the principle and the way it was handled.","2013-09-02","0","-L88B-PrtzwujhLuYc2k_g","gLM2CrIAm5WP7viKCJKstg"

The staff were less attentive than before with less energy and waiter was defensive to any feedback we provided when he asked. Found out from the bus boy new ownership took over in Nov 2014. Food was boring, presentation odd, and dessert was a pile of blue cheese on a plate. I'd pay anyone money to see if they could finish it.

"Karbouzi is by far the best Greek restaurant in this area. High quality ingredients prepared properly. The way they form the chicken around the skewer (large souvlaki dinner) keeps it really moist. Its unique, I had not seen it before. It's slightly more expensive (i.e.pita is extra) then the typical fast Greek restaurant is. But when your craving some Greek comfort food it's well worth it. I have not been to any other Greek restaurant since I found this little gem on orderit.ca.","2013-06-13","0","gcec09O3lhUrzqXNJq0QVQ","2f3gd7XEmJgQZyx9vr5pfA"

"The restaurant management has serious problems. We overheard that 2 ppl sat down on a reserved table, which does not have a reservation plate on it. And no one stopped them at the sight. After a while, a waitress told them that the table is reserved and asked them to leave. Like everyone else, those 2 ppl actually spent a long time waiting in line in this cold morning. It's not fair to ask customers to leave when it's the restaurant's problem. The chef made a huge scene out of it. Its ridiculous","2014-01-19","0","DQf63-KJ25m-kDIMto614g","coAQ-Sy3AfRQed18RUGdDA"

"Gas is generally cheaper than other shell stations. However, there is plenty of rage from the motorists. Another thing is to avoid the car wash. The gentleman running it seems to be an angry man. I went to use the car wash and it stopped working. I brought it to his  attention and he accused me of trying to bamboozle him out of $2 when I often spend $200 per month at this station. If you come here gas up quickly and leave.","2013-04-07","0","5NaYJD-LSwHhGRHuMFZ1fQ","2lxlixN7CfEUzybhmSbSZg"
"It was 5:50 pm and I had a flat. Luckily I was in the area and the 6 pm closing time was coming soon the gentleman agreed to help me out. Initially the shop thought that the tire was repairable and needed to be replaced. Fortunately, a mechanic notice that there was no internal damage so he recommended to  keep the tire.  Three weeks later the tire is still fine. I have the highest respect for them

I tried Home Of the Brave for the first time last night and I am DISGUSTED by the service. As someone who works in the industry I know very well how to treat guests. It's sad because the restaurant was immaculate, beautiful decor, a very large bar and a great atmosphere. My server Matt was downright disrespectful. 15 minutes after being seated we placed our combined drink and food order. Once we received our beers he proceeded to call us ""kids"" (my boyfriend is 28 and I'm 24).  (Pt.2 --)","2014-02-25","0","bhqOSajw2x1NLQxijsDVcg","kPRM3DWjpWIwguX1e0d2Qg"

"Tried the new seafood portion downstairs today because steak house upstairs was too busy. 

I can say the seafood was way more enjoyable than the usual steak house upstairs. My only complaint is that it's very cold by the stairs and nothing stayed warm on our plates.  The service downstairs with the seafood is also much better than any service we have ever had upstairs.","2015-01-10","0","GcxE5hK_TaHP4EZFDYz2mg","fqIdgpwtzVBo-vy8rI7rvg"

"First time going to this place and I don't regret it at all! It seems like a family run business and they were really friendly :) I also can't even explain how great the food is! I got the Ddukbokki and the Kimpap, it added to the total of $9. To me it was a very good price and it made me very full! I'm definately going back to try one of their korean pancakes or hot pots :)","2013-11-24","0","d3olNIBeuH4Eeqc3mkX8LA","H3l-XTsVsus8lVZEXvc_4A"

Every time I go, you can count on a huge grey cloud of smoke and chicken smell, within an awesome giant oil drum.

Being Vietnamese and having traveled back to Viet Nam numerous times, I can honestly say that the food here couldn't get any more authentic! The spring rolls are AMAZING!!! Grilled chicken with rice is awesomely good and the pho (beef noodle soup) definitely the spot! Service is friendly yet simple, when you're paying $7-8 for an entrée....you can't expect much.

"Usually come here for breakfast. Really like the egg LT meal (number 7 on the menu) except for the cheese. 

The cheese tastes very processed, just like Kraft cheese slices or something. Really takes away from the meal. The other stuff is good and eggs are of high quality for fast food

The fish portion was very small in comparison to the amount of fries, and I couldn't keep eating the fries. Also the ""light"" batter was not all that light to help cover up how small the fish was. Not worth $12 for this type of food, def have had better. Tarter sauce was also just packaged instead of restaurant made.","2013-06-20","0","FPjlyNITZALDdcnfhnZ9Xg","Z4IpXBuya2UY3OXTkbLGtg"

"When we made an inquiry, the details seemed reasonable. After we made our reservation, we found out about an extra $75 cleaning fee that was not in the quote. When we pointed out this (mistake? misrepresentation?), our reservation was immediately *cancelled* because they, quote, ""pride themselves on customer satisfaction"". I guess you maintained high customer satisfaction--technically--by firing us before we were a paying customer? J Palen is at minimum rigid, if not dishonest.

"Don't get fooled! They get good reviews because they'll give you a bottle of soju for a review. They are pricey, charge by the minutes, and don't have a lot of English songs. Do not get the soju, is just juice with a splash of alcohol.","2014-09-13","0","l3joBBpkq0ib11dKUpKMAw","mUe0BHepCcT0CNPQXisAbw"
"Avoid! Purchased a bedroom set from their North las Vegas location in February, it is April and I still have not received the whole set. Also, they give you a 3 hours delivery window but may not show up. You'll have to call them to reschedule.","2014-04-07","0","52dAt8dkOpy1b86kUcsX1Q","mUe0BHepCcT0CNPQXisAbw"

"Here's my pro tip for this place.

*What they have in the show room is not what they have in stock. I purchased a bedroom set but had to wait 3 weeks for them to get it. 

*They give you a 3 hour delivery window but they'll show up 3 - 6 hours after that. When you call them to ask when they'll deliver it, they'll tell you that they are on the way or finishing up at another delivery.

*They will offer you a $50 - $75 refund to get you off the phone but you'll never see it.","2014-04-07","0","4spdGV6-49W3NZ1cdZ6XnA","mUe0BHepCcT0CNPQXisAbw"
