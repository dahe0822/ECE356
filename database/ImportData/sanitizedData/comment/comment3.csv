_5PJ4GHIXNdUdXtohylKGQ,I ordered the ""Canoewreck,"" one of the all-day breakfast items and one of only a couple of vegetarian items. It seemed heavy on the filler carbs, with two full slices of heavily buttered toast and lots of potatoes in the tofu hash.  It also was quite salty. I would have been glad to have less toast and more fruit (the tiniest slice of pineapple, cantaloupe, and orange - hidden under all that toast). Plus it seemed a bit pricey for the amount of actual hash it offered. Won't order that again.,2013-10-28,AlKwXxhPdj5bkdYDRO7gtw

The man was so rude and was talking to me in such a demeaning, paternalistic way. (By the way, I'm a 33 year old professional, not a teen or anything.) I think he honestly was just having a bad day and needed someone to be unkind to because the things he was saying to me didn't even make sense.

efTPzpiSkxbgNlQOtwyVOA,Skip it. Requested a table when we made our reservation (medical thing). Disregarded that, offered a booth, so we had to wait 30min for a table. Waiter was terrible. Steaks were good (not great) but cooked well. Salad was bagged. Scallop entree was overpriced. One order was wrong (prime rib came instead of strip) but waiter made it our fault. Had to wait 20min for her meal, had to ask for bread. Value was a bit sub-par. Decor is old school. Try Longhorn instead. :-\/,2013-05-12,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w

This is a better place to catch up with an old friend, rather than work by yourself on your MacBook. Great little independent place, not enough of these left.,2013-08-12,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w
QvltB7RjVOVRBl685azJ5g,Visited 2 locations within a week. Amazing & consistent. Awesome happy hour specials, 3-6p 1\/2-off apps & flatbreads. Shrimp tacos, tots are great! Fantastic cocktails ($9 normally, $5 at happy hour).,2013-07-06,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w
yBbqFPuwFiaom435KOY4cg,Good food, good value. Busy for weekday lunch but not packed. Ask for the WiFi code. Menu is a bit overwhelming for newbies  (but only in terms if what tastes best with what). Got a great, filling, fresh, healthy, spicy and flavorful bowl plus a bottle of water for $8.50. I like it hot and mine was plenty spicy for sure (in a good way!). 4.5\/5 stars.,2013-06-27,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w
1gQrMs-I8oKg2p-iRxznzQ,Soho is Soso. Hip decor, nice patio, great flank steak, sweet $3 craft bottle list. But everything else...nothing to write home about. $50\/2.,2012-08-18,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w
Ufo0Papm3oyoCfBvnsJH7g,RIP. Permanently closed Saturday 12\/31\/2016, sold to Boaz Cafe.,2017-01-01,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w
Va-2xSF5L1x5SYeXLK_eCQ,Meatball Sub ($7) was good and decently portioned (3 meatballs), and the side salad (romaine) was crisp and fresh ($3). House Italian dressing was great! Can't wait to try the (Angie's) pizza.,2012-06-13,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w
Vvco32XScCqccm7mjS5L9g,$10 min for CC. $3.25 for a small (2-scoops, 1-2 flavors, cup or cone). SO good. A ton of unique, ever-changing flavors (a la Jeni's, but more fun). Cocoa Puffs ice cream was awesome, as was everything else we tried. Made on premises, very fresh. Can't eat there but there are cool benches right outside under the tree, or hit Lincoln Park across the street (if it's still daylight). Love it.,2013-07-20,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w
cF98fzqrMnikhXhuSz6ruQ,Loved the old Deagans menu (including C&W). Quality here is not even close. Difficult to find a positive on this visit, sadly. Sub-par and expensive. No repeats for us.,2013-03-30,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w
WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg,Cool joint! Tiny place, hip, very casual, cheap. Tacos & burritos are huge. Get 1 taco + split a small chips\/vegan guac and you're set. Get a side sauce or 2, not a ton of flavor naked. Everything was great, especially the citrus cilantro sauce and homemade lemonade (especially with a shot of Absolut!) Wish they had the fish tacos everyday in the summer instead of only Friday. Great craft beer & liquor selection with fun signature drinks. Pigged out + alcohol for about $25 for 2. We'll be back.,2013-06-29,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w
WGkqfp1-3130v8xhCb3APg,Authentic? No. Delicious? Yes. Lemonade (spiked?), one taco ($4.50) and shared order of chips & vegan guac (really just regular guac) did it for me. Friday fish tacos are good, great for the price.,2013-07-15,s_WC97T4fwpgEADYkGeS-w

Food was pretty good (turkey omlette, b'fast burrito, small soup, a Papa Mocha and a chai), and our server was super friendly; however, the barista who rang up our cheque was rude. I understand she was busy during the brunch crowd, but do I really need to wait wait for my receipt after paying for our meal? I don't think so.

02E9r4BQzVrA76Bf7G-KMw,This pizza is the equivalent of Taco Bell food. It's only good at 2am when you are really drunk. Sober you realize it's not made under the most sanitary conditions. The workers all wear sleeveless shirts and do not have AC so you can see the sweat dripping off them. They also don't wear gloves or hair nets and they do not wash there hands between touching money and making your pizza. Frankly I'm surprised the health department has never been involved.,2013-07-21,Na3FnrwMltjTDWN4JjeKIA

xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,We've been customers of theirs ever since they operated out of their house in Twinsburg. Their popularity has made them expand into a store. Don't worry about the location. The wait time for the food is a necessity. Everything is made from scratch! If I had to recommend one thing, it would be extremely difficult. The chicken tikka masala, the goat, the butter chicken, the paneer dishes, malai kofta, poori, everything is really good and authentic! Highly recommend calling ahead for pickup.,2015-11-13,pNMgOtz1YsU4pjch3qPT2g

OkLqpxpbvU2N2-OGDn0yiA,The pistachio rose creme brûlée was TO DIE FOR. Usually, desserts with rose flavors either completely lack the essence of it or don't do it justice. This creme brûlée was the perfect balance of pistachio and rose, with a flamed, crisp top to contrast the decadent overall creaminess. I wish I didn't share it three-ways. I'm getting one for myself next time.,2016-01-26,w1WE83erjPJTysuAbjoRgA
51kUjAGZLtDl1K3XV_UXxQ,Substitute mango for any added sugar! Great with the avocolada and the triple berry oat! They might charge extra for it, so beware if you don't want to push your bill to over $6 for a 24 oz smoothie.

eBoRFMm14n6Bte5vJIaeSg,If you're hungry and want something quick, order take out through the online site and pick it up. Definitely don't come when it's a discount wing night (Tuesday or Thursday) AND a game. Took us 40 minutes to get our food. If you don't mind your company and you have time, then it's not a problem! College games are starting up again and students are back to school so it was noticeably busier.,2015-09-03,w1WE83erjPJTysuAbjoRgA
VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA,Be prepared for a long wait if you come during a peak rush hour. We went to the Tremont location on a Friday night around 9 PM and waited around an hour and a half. People still come back and wait, if that tells you anything about how good this place is. If there is an event downtown (like a Cavs game) the wait might be longer so just keep that in mind. If you're in a hurry, know what you want to order and get your checks right away!,2016-03-13,w1WE83erjPJTysuAbjoRgA

g2lCNg_IM8_0I7K-jafRVQ,We arrived at cleats and saw the cooks outside, looking dirty and smoking. At first I didn't know they were the cooks but after I heard this extremely loud obnoxious and obscene rap music coming from the kitchen I saw the same people cooking my food. 12\/7\/12 @6:43pm. Cooks 2 white males,2012-12-07,afhGnIFLZ4WAnld6JaydJg
g2lCNg_IM8_0I7K-jafRVQ,I asked numerous times to lower the bass booming obscene language music,.but the manager never came over and never asked the Cooks to lower it. I will never go back.

hTdV1_Xn1j6yhpIR7CgCJQ,Lobster brothers is a very nice piece of the sea. I finally found a place that sold a whole octopus . The staff were super helpful and friendly and had a plethora of seafood choices. The only downside was the humongous portions of fried entrees. I'm a big eater and I love to chow down and although the food was good it was a little too greasy for me. I will buy the fresh stuff and cook it myself next time. The clam chowder was to die for and the crab cashless were awesome,2013-03-03,afhGnIFLZ4WAnld6JaydJg

LNsZJP6jZ11e0tDljOLPiQ,I never go to Ohio City because of the high crime incidents. But I decided to enter Town Hall because it looked cool and it was still day time around 6 pm. The waitress told us to sit anywhere in the patio, so we did and waited 15 minutes for sometime to acknowledge us. Then as we were drinking our beers, some drunk guy grand a stone from the walls and throws it towards me. I almost got into a fight but decided to leave the establishment with my fiance as the guy passes out on the patio. Sucks!,2013-07-15,afhGnIFLZ4WAnld6JaydJg

The amount of avocado is about 1\/16th of the rice, so as much as I love Sasa--and usually avocado rolls--I would advise AGAINST them here as its a rice roll, really. :\/,2015-08-14,UVDUl5SZ0gNmgLzurmQb5Q
YyyqcbVyoBo4wPsgowUtUQ,Just in case you're thinking of ordering food to go, do so from your house and then come in for a drink. We watched four couples get their food, eat it, some even ordered desert, and then all left before we even got ours--which we had ordered to go from the bar. Sasa is slow on the weekends, but 45 minutes for 3 rolls? That's just insulting.,2015-09-18,UVDUl5SZ0gNmgLzurmQb5Q
FC2wDc27USi6cx2GCGYaXQ,If you order the artichoke and red pepper dip (and yes it's good, so do), be sure to ask for the accompanying pita chips WITHOUT the sugar.

fja2EnaSxKu1D7uctMhw-w,Great lobster- good food. Clams casino are too dry and flavorless - couldn't taste a clam at all. Bartender was a jerk. At 5pm opening time, our table needed 5 minutes. The bartender gave my teenager shit for sitting on a bar stool- in a completely empty bar. His attitude and the way he presented his bullshit was- bullshit. I may not be a liquor law attorney, but my husband has been for 35 years and the bartenders shitty demeanor on Christmas Eve was ridiculous. Power hungry freak.,2016-12-25,E2y89HCftIj0PRf_-UARVA

De3H_BPFam3bJHPrbI93xA,I bought a cigar here that was very plugged up, and I ended up having to pitch it less than half way through because it just wouldn't produce enough smoke, even after trying numerous times to re-light it, and re-cutting it a little bit to try to open it up more. Not sure if it was a construction issue with the cigar from the factory, or if it was an issue caused by the store storing the cigar at an improper humidity level\/temperature in their humidor, but regardless, I'm not particularly happy.,2017-06-07,oPQAJEiJnRrD0Km5RlKmtw

fNAdDV7HCYnq6P69UGl7kg,They flat-out REFUSE to give seperate checks for multiple customers if they are in the same car, which is completly absurd!!! Each car is on one check, which is super annoying!!! My friends have literally had to get out of my car and stand in another parking space just to be able to order and pay for their own food seperatly!!! It's ridiculous, and it means that if one person wants to use a credit card but the other wants to use cash, you're out of luck, cause you've got to split the same check.,2015-10-18,oPQAJEiJnRrD0Km5RlKmtw

This location is very nice (Winking Lizard has many great locations throughout Northeast Ohio),, and it is located at the center of the very scenic and historic city of Peninsula, which is inside of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and within walking\/biking distance of the park's most popular trails and attractions.,2015-10-05,oPQAJEiJnRrD0Km5RlKmtw
-Eu04UHRqmGGyvYRDY8-tg,The market is amazing, and the variety is huge, but beware of getting ripped off at the fruit and veggie stands in the produce building. Most of the fruit and veggie stands in the market buy their inventory from the same wholesalers that regular grocery stores buy from. Unless your buying exotic fruits or veggies that you can't find anywhere else, you're better off just sticking to shopping in the main building of the market where the meat, seafood, bakery, and prepared foods are sold.,2017-11-13,oPQAJEiJnRrD0Km5RlKmtw
IzEHkReZTds6ipOaCq2G6g,This is NOT a good concert venue. Every time that I've been here, the crowd has been completly out of control. The majority of the concert-goers were extremely intoxicated, and many were smoking marijuana. Being stuck next to these people in this ""standing-room only"" venue is always a really unpleasant and dangerous experience. The staff at The House of Blues are awful at providing security services, and they don't know how to control the crowd.,2015-07-14,oPQAJEiJnRrD0Km5RlKmtw

daLUceDcNHEIxLHObOH18g,I'm not a fan of the new plates that they use, or the new way that they present their burgers and fries. After the ""redesign"" of the restaurant, the burgers and fries no longer come in plastic baskets, they come on these ""trendy"" little plates, with the fries served inside of a little metal ring. The portions of ""bottomless"" fries are now way too small, and they barely refill them when you ask them to. Also, the burgers used to be served in a wrapper, which made them much easier to eat.,2016-01-12,oPQAJEiJnRrD0Km5RlKmtw

cOcplwKfHIT3gwOGnGt_Sw,For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, it is a SUBURBAN\/RURAL national park. It is NOT what most would consider a ""traditional"" national park. Tens of thousands of people live within the boundries of the CVNP, with numerous cities, towns, and villiages making up a large percentage of the park land. A percentage of the park land is also shared with the Cleveland Metroparks. For these reasons, the park maps, signs, and borders can be difficult to understand.,2015-12-25,oPQAJEiJnRrD0Km5RlKmtw

1NNBpiQ3rUT-7T8ch45SVA,Anybody who says that they don't like The Cheesecake Factory is either lying to you, or they don't know what the hell they're talking about!!!

S9KZksiBeXvTs7qZ235v9g,The cashier in the convienence store was a jerk when I went in there last summer. I went in there with my friend (who WAS NOT shopping with me and was paying seperatly for his own items), and I went to the counter to buy a tin of Skoal. The casher started yelling at me for no reason and DEMANDED to see my friend's ID. Not wanting any trouble and not wanting to have to go somewhere else to make my tobacco purchase, we both showed him our IDs (and yes, we were both over 18).

NhYd0y0k0LhoV969eswC3g,Killer Gyro's!!!,2016-02-17,lBP_0ciJhjJpnKAmUTokEg
NhYd0y0k0LhoV969eswC3g,I'm a gyro fanatic. But sadly, with food, comes service. I ordered my gyro to-go, the bartender was very rude on the phone. We started a conversation while she prepared my gyro. One of the reasons while I'll never give this place my business again is because she asked me if I was ""strong enough"" after I told her my soon-to-be occupation(law school) How rude! My other reason is the bag of chips that came with my gyro was half eaten when I got home. Disgusting! Very rude staff and a cheap mindset.,2016-05-26,ffTrt5lys06Ir9XzjqtjSg

F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,I didn't understand the hype. The restraunt is very dark, and i hate eating in the dark. The guacamole is different, I prefer a standard guacamole with lime and more kick, but I respect their take. Definitely make a reservation to get a table, there isn't much seating. I think it's hard to enjoy any food without proper seating! Also, not very Mexican at all, there wasn't even salt or lime on the table. Overall, definitely didn't understand modern Mexican..,2014-04-12,I1jILDFznpJr3taQvRuy8g
IarLBVbjB_rLDdZeCg-ydg,restraunt is cute, but not worth the food. they had about one page of food choices and 2 pages of drinks. the manmade greens are very bland and synthesized tasting, and I felt the trout was overly fried and not seasoned. in my opinion, at higher priced restraunts, fish should be grilled or steamed, not fried. the salad was mainly stems and not leaves. overall, not enough creativity and you pay the same prices elsewhere and will get a salad with your plate.,2013-04-13,I1jILDFznpJr3taQvRuy8g

The video games are mostly quite aged with the arcade machines on the second floor being the oldest.  Some of them didn't even have slots large enough for the new tokens.

ipFreSFhjClfNETuMjBtrA,It was A balmy Sunday afternoon so spouse and I though to enjoy the patio and maybe a movie after lunch here at Doogans. We both ordered chicken Gorgonzola salads. Sounded great. Had walnuts, raisins with a balsamic dressing with grilled chicken. Chicken was perfect: moist inside, grilled outside. All ingredients were fresh. It just didn't have the zing I expected from Gorgonzola. So it was good. Not really good. Last time spouse had the same salad she recalls it was ""really good"".,2014-08-17,awF4toYWn5kobojnLxPTNA

7JOo6MO-bJMhfXobJG7SRQ,Ordered my first burger here to share w\/my husband.  If I would have known how yummy it was going to be,  I wouldn't have shared it at all! Lol.  It was perfect!  The burger covered the entire bun,  and it was the right bun for the burger.  It didn't fall apart & wasn't too much. Cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  Don't insult this burger with any topping.  It needs nothing.  They serve it w\/lettuce,  tomato & onion,  but my advice,  hold it all!  Just enjoy the deliciousness!,2016-03-15,VL1WciwE6BO1VJ0GhF7-rA

Ours arrived stone cold w the cheese barely melted (it was like shredded cheese from the bag sprinkled over chips without heating them).  Sent back and they came back semi melted and Luke warm. The ""cheese"" turned out to be velveta.  Awful.  The signature ""garbage burger"" was devoid of flavor even w the multiple toppings. A tavern should be able to pull off a burger.

I get they're new but my god (shout out to Adam- one of the worst). The place is very well set up and decorated with a nice patio. It's the same owners of blue moose in Parma and barley house on west 6th which makes sense. Bottom line come here for beer skip out on the food though.

rZpXmd43n82bUijNqBu0uw,Bad meal. Had to send back. Prime rib ordered as medium came all red and luke warm. Tough and grissily. Mashed potatoes were garlic which I can't eat. Waitress tried to charge me $5.99 for lousy salad bar. Lettuce was wilted and dry. Not many toppings. Butter was warm. Waitress was nice. Being 4th generation food business I would NOT order anything else. Had to leave since diabetic and I had taken fast acting insulin in search of food.,2014-06-07,GdRYc4iN7Fk0y_lOLrfF_w

11JpKLTgSGMlkK_HmQsjaQ,Great prices for seasonal food.  I always like their bulk pre-packaged items when you first walk in.  Also their lemons last a long time because I buy a bunch and keep them in the fridge, and a few months later they aren't soft nor moldy. You can find stuff that's going bad in the far back, I've purchased hot peppers back there and cleaned em up right away then froze them for cooking later.

_quVlmD-dxLi3y3k8t1izg,Rental was painless, but upon return, had $15 late fee. No one in our group heard this but that they claimed to have told everyone about. The attraction is to rent bikes, ride north and then ride the train back. Train arrives at 5:05. I would think they would account. Also, rental staff thought it would be a good idea to give me a bike that had a nearly flat tire with the caveat that they just put air in and to come back if it was a problem. I insisted on having a bike they knew to hold air.,2013-06-16,OKQqqs717WbSSt56EQBE-Q

You can save a bit by hitting happy hour between 4 and 7 with $2 off glass wines and $8 Flat Breads or Bar Plates. The patio is a great place to relax but it is in a strip mall type setting, so the view leaves a bit to be desired. That doesn't matter much if you bring your own beauty to sit across from you. = ),2014-06-23,FqNT4NXpauSXVzP9TXHkMg

The result was a very dry dish that required multiple cups of salsa to provide flavor and moisture.,2013-06-26,VvwrCpL2_uMrRumFWo7nLQ
