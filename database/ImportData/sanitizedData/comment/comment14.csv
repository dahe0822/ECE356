q8D-tlj8pQPXAtdUC3409w,I just stopped in for a snack and I just saw an awful public display of staff mistreatment. As I was checking out, one of the cashiers, a heavy-set blonde woman (whom I am assuming is a lead or assistant manager because of her attitude) chose to berate my cashier in front of customers, a small Indian woman, who just kept saying ""yes, ma'am"" to her. What a vile woman that was. The woman checking me out kept smiling, despite how she was being treated. Large blonde lady, you are a jerk. #FireHer,2016-02-02,shYLM4g_3C5LU4Jb7KW0eQ

7tNY4BYLA4laqWNV4IWGQg,For this style of pizza, it's hard to beat this place. If its Chicago deep dish you're looking for, turn back around!,2014-05-17,wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg
A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA,I came here a few years ago and service was sub-par. So far nothing has changed. Learn how to greet your customers within 20 minutes of seating them.,2014-05-30,wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg

01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ,Temporarily closed due to a kitchen fire , went to their sister restaurant on spring mountain and was told they should be back up and running in about a week,2017-11-24,wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg
f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ,Hands down, the best salt and pepper pork chops. They are a little bit on the fattier side though, just a warning.,2017-05-21,wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg
1iZJlc1b6FfRsWa3FHm4lw,I'm not going to review this place because I may just not have a taste for this type of beverage, so it wouldn't be fair. But I will honestly tell you that at a hefty price of$12.50, the ""bee grateful"" is by far the worst tasting beverage I've ever had in my mouth. Ever. It does come in a cool bottle though.,2017-09-16,wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg
YNjavvZq9SasjkIndOOK4Q,Most of their burgers come with grilled onions but you can request raw onions if you prefer.,2016-09-28,wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg
YNjavvZq9SasjkIndOOK4Q,I decided to give their tri-tip sandwich a try and was a little disappointed. They prepare it medium (although mine came out medium rare) but the issue was that it was super tough, like there was too much tendon in it? I may have just got a bad cut but that won't change my review. Service, cleanliness and value were still good. I'll try the tuna next time.,2016-09-28,wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg
mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ,Temporarily closed due to a kitchen fire from the restaurant next door - hopefully they'll be back up and running again soon!,2017-11-24,wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg
mOF_0nlTRu5NxOu6MsOAQQ,They DO take credit card at this location even though their menus all say cash only. The cash only places might just be their California locations.,2017-05-23,wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg

They make it so obvious to keep an eye on us (especially him) because they talk shit through the little headset and EVERYONE stares and whispers.

Cxd0CSaDsCmPqSCFkQDfIQ,Always the worst service at the counter but best service in the drive thru. Inside, I am never greeted or smiled at and it's typically the same tall, young guy (black hair) working in the early afternoon. He obviously has no desire to be working there because his disdain for his position is clearly evident in his agitation at taking orders. I'd rather drive an extra block out of my way than stop here.,2014-08-13,9KedzFFaQSK06pl25KcjhQ
-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA,Standards on the decline. We have been to Le Thai a couple of times and always had excellent food. Service is typically good too. Today however, I ordered the ginger fried rice and after two bites I chewed down on something hard and unbreakable. I removed what looked like a small black rock from my plate. I lost my appetite and told my server. She said she would let her manager know but no one came out to apologize or anything. We got our check an left and sadly will choose elsewhere next time.,2014-07-23,9KedzFFaQSK06pl25KcjhQ

Obviously, with her unpleasant response I declined to get a ""large pizza"" ( which would have been a better profit for the pizza place) so...I went with the medium. If it wasn't for that, or if I had a different person to service me, I would come back. Now I hope the pizza makes up for it.,2013-07-17,2K9euYBrRA0l0JbGay4SJg

I've gone in a few times to pick up my prescriptions but I normally do the drive thru. The line inside can be long, but it is a pharmacy. Outside there is another ""prescription drop off"" lane that I find helpful. I've noticed that if they give an ETA for prescriptions, don't get there at that time.
