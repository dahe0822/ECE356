They always give plenty of notice too. When I am ready to buy a home, I will definitely use this company.,2014-02-24,6nG_bwcTR5PodwXxUoRkXw,

We are regulars never experienced it like this. Staff to busy flirting was messing around with eachother to care. Although the pizza pasta side was fine and stocked.

oyluXrwjEp0EUIKJguGmDA,If you can only play one course choose Sun Mountain. I have been playing these tracks since the late 90's. Grounds are heavily watered do not expect the typical LV fairway roll; 7000 yards plays 7000 yards. Fair and challenging tee boxes for women. Choose these courses over Reflection Bay. Always swing hard. Do not drink hard liqueur if temp is above 90 choose beer or candied drinks instead.,2013-05-01,mynqFfV_vyNJCiKnp9b75A,

zt-NIGZ9HgTUPkIc36LI9A,Dr Mabey is wonderful as a doctor and has been for many years. He delivered my first child 23 years ago. He's a great listener and is non-judgmental. He is deserving of more than 5 stars...sadly, it's the long time receptionist he's had that makes the experience less than welcoming. She's been there about 20 years and she's rude. Today she told me that she doesn't look into the insurance and she wouldn't know what my copay would be. Really? Well then how do you paid? Real nice.

Q9v3zXGR2TduAKzn5B1BhQ,I've seen both the dermatologist and esthetician.  They aren't helpful. You have to go in with questions preplanned or they won't tell you anything, and even if you do ask, they give you poor answers with little information.

ZOmf-3NN4Z59b2Fw6VAM7g,Our 1st visit was better. Today is busy, they cannot keep up with lack of staff. 15 tables, 1 waitress, 2 bussers, and 1 cashier. Seated ourselves. We're brought menus and the filthy table went unnoticed. Took over 5 minutes for a drink order and 10-15 to place our food order. Add 40 min to receive our food. We were appalled at how they conduct business. Huge water puddle under our neighbors shoes and wet mark from bus tub. Of course there were no apologies. Beware.

ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw,At best, this is a 3 star buffet. No offense to the hard workers who prepare the food here but the variety is so so and the quality is not that great. In my mind, that's a management issue of mediocre expectations and tolerance for ""ok"" food. However, my waitress is very very pleasant though.,2012-09-24,IEGXLjj72cjxehzGrwt1GA,
CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw,Although the menu items are authentic Mandarin and Szechuan dishes, the preparation is highly ""Americanized"" and not very authentic. I'd give the food quality 3 stars and service 3.5 stars. If you want authentic Chinese, go to Chinatown. I just didn't feel like going out and that was a mistake.,2012-09-23,IEGXLjj72cjxehzGrwt1GA,

I made a CASH deposit on a Friday, April 28 at 5:30 at the ATM (that scans the cash for you, no more envelopes) and called the following Wednesday to ask why I was charged an overdraft fee for one of my bills that hit my account on Wednesday.

They couldn't even help a lady with a disability and were so rude to her that I stepped in to offer my help. The doctors are ok, had my sons surgery here and it worked. But the process to make appts and to be seen are ridiculous. It's been a draining experience to get my boyfriend to be seen.

Update : there was a staffing issue seems to be resolved.  As for preschool it is not traditional and they do not have a daily lesson plan or use worksheets ,desks and things like that but my daughter has fun playing with the other kids. So we will continue to attend until it is our turn (on the waitlist ) for a traditional preschool. Nice staff, good daycare.,2014-08-28,nI2gZyZReOun6PSPlq7iSw,

azxeH9W14hzFnZyuOm8JdQ,Hmmm, nice place, but as a past employee in a restaurant, 2 negative things...there was no hostess to seat people and the sign said, ""please wait to be seated"" (no one knew where she was). Then, there was a LOT of loud ""whooping"" in the back, which probably echoes, but when your hostess is no where to be found and there is a ""party"" going on in the back, it makes guests feel a little neglected.  We are on a time schedule in the airport and don't have time to listen to the staff party.,2013-11-27,qYxn0CS7ZfV-k1fm8e6J9g,

I even called to check up on the order and they said that it would be another 20 min. After an hour I decided to eat something else and after I was done eating they decided to call me and say it would take another 20 min. I told them FORGET IT! I can't tell anyone how the food taste from this place because I didn't try it. But I must say customer service SUCKS!,2013-06-24,CfmU073Uo8UfU-0rQBvppg,

I_SW8XCxWtwUfC1ow6QLrw,After your eyes adjust to the darkness, you're welcomed by several employees. I ordered a Philly cheese steak and was immediately happy one I bit into it. Real. Genuine Philly. Fresh. Music transports you to the 80's. My comfort zone. Smoking allowed, and I partook in the situation. Grew drinks, not watered down. I'm happy. Suggest if you are wanting a place to hang out, to stop by and see for yourself.,2016-04-20,VXGqUPJKanF6eJRnJEYOPw,
mjhwLcuoenVW8oFhcNmlHA,Horrible service, burgers took over 20 minutes and came to the table room temperature. Sent them back and the manager said it was the cold lettuce and vegetables making the burger cold. She suggested we get our remakes with fixings on the side. Another 20 minutes. Burgers were hit, but the delays were not acceptable. They didn't comp a single item, but gave us 3 red velvet cakes to take home. Waste of $50 and we will never go back.

1rxumiF6MypngptYBPA01Q,Amazing place. It is so hard to find an honest vet that cares for your four legged friends as they do here. The whole staff is amazing. Dr. Fujikawa took care of my very outgoing cat Ted and she was amazing. When I went back I tried to get her again but she was full and since I was pressed for time with my dog having a large abscess, Dr. Hayward took care of her instead and she was incredible. Leeloo found her new doctor and we will only be coming back here from now on. THANK YOU!,2016-08-28,W8JJGXuBqhdmQoSDoB7Wqg,

ebTvBxSStI9Vf5Tpux_X3Q,Been coming here since Orleans opened.  This tip is more of a tip from 2014 til present.  Every dealer, bartender, waitress in every part and shift of this casino is boring, demanding, ride, sarcastic, and has no warmth.  Customer service doesn't exist here.  If not for comps and a few mutual friends in bands that perform here, I wouldn't ever come based on service.  It's God awful.,2016-08-04,NJxfyWtbOi9WDxAvfgqLIg,
ii8sAGBexBOJoYRFafF9XQ,The entirety of the party pit dealers aren't that pretty and they're extremely rude.  All night.  Eye contact, customer service, warmth, professionalism is all void.

ZtsnwjxjzMUI6tDZNrJUeA,The food, service, and music were on the same frequency as I was.  As a gambler and a fan of oldies, plus some bomb steak, I was surprised how well my visit went.  The steak here was better than the five dollar ones at some locations.  Better than the fancier deal breaking steaks at $14.  For $8.95 I felt it was cooked like a medium rare.  Which doesn't happen often where I thought the steak came out the way I wanted.  Mark on graveyard was a great bartender.  One of my favorites.  Come down,2015-09-18,NJxfyWtbOi9WDxAvfgqLIg,

5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,The ramen noodles were weird.  The broth doesn't taste like a tradiitional or well made broth.  The servers and chefs were all uncoordinated constantly yelling out questions and orders with uncertainty.  The 4 star rating is a misleading one cuz they are other places to get a ramen fix.  Hand made doesn't mean much if they're not good.  I did enjoy the black garlic oil, and the way the cook their tofu.  Although the spice was on the light side.  For spice and ramen nuts, this is a let down.,2016-10-17,NJxfyWtbOi9WDxAvfgqLIg,

mzGdeqiViX1XfVe0kLvqBA,Went there and got a rear wheel bearing replaced. Cost me $540. The exact wheel bearing lasted only 17 months since I had it fixed. Went back and they said my warranty is over and it's gonna cost me $540 again. Since when does a wheel bearing last only 17 months? My car is a 2006 and all the rest of the wheel bearings is in good shape since I bought the car. I don't know if it's cheap parts or labor wasn't quality. Live and learn.

So they swapped the 16"" new tire i bought to a 15"" new tire on a FREE 15"" wheel. I dont care what anyone negative says about this place. Because these people have a heart. And they saved me!

I like that you can get toppings per slice if you want. Unmelted cheese may be the most common by locals. It's good but I taste cheese all night when I do it.,2012-12-31,CdiR6iA2LndH1m4atajOwg,

""how was everything"" is asked at a resturant...not at this place though ..pizza was undercooked and is best described as medium rare.  There is a reason that the last award given to this place was in 1992..your non getting awards is old enough to drink.

We were nervous because we read some negative reviews online, but the price was very reasonable. The food was excellent! We couldnt have been happier with the food and the service was great! Thats all every1 talked about besides the wedding being so nice was that the food was great and who was the caterer! 5 stars on food and service!

The bread is always stale plus our waitress embarrassingly told us you got to pay for extra bread if you order the pasta.Who in Pittsburgh charges extra for bread. Travelling from Clairton isn't worth the drive. I'll go to Ciccanti's or Hill's in New Eagle. They serve fresh bread with no extra charge. Esta just lost the 2 of us plus 6 family members who met there from the  Leechburg area.,2016-05-08,yLA49JbkmrU45FZuWRPOhw,

hbXM32Np33qJYmx8HUtXXw,One word sum this place up.. Awful.  The kitchen and dining area was dirty, the pizza by the slice they served us was old, like 3 hours and reheated. One of the employees cooking walks into the front door smoking a cigarette with no remorse for well, the only two people in the dump. and start handling things in the kitchen. Pizza was terrible. Terrible!  Food inspection needs to have a field day with this place.,2013-06-17,BkaRcGIoAwAt0bWEOZXKvQ,

TYZIMuHwhZo_Hizenmf8Pg,Had a Yelp check in offer for 50% off two 'smalls' (apps). I won't come close to eating it all, but for essentially the same price, I got to have goat cheese (Gorgonzola?) crostini(very good) and portobello mushroom tacos (delicious!). The music mostly stinks (classic crap, not even good classic rock) but comfortable eating hear solo. Close to the 6th and 7th bridges. Casual dining. Nice service.,2013-07-28,Mv2RWEOKXjsocE0VGSsQ7w,
err0FvoRGGSqORd8WRtppA,So, it's no Sassafras, but what is? Love that they have this old-timey bar in a old timey hotel. Great menu with loads of Pgh history. Great music of the era. Wishing people would use hushed tones but that's no fault of the bar. Have your flashlight app ready to read the menu. It's dark in here; as it should be, so just a tip.

Ambiance sitting outside was pretty nice, service was pretty slow\/bordering on inattentive, food-while portions were small it was overall  pretty tasty. For apps, we got chips & salsa and 2 kinds of serviche.  The best sauce was the red - smoky & good. Serviche 2 ways = disappointment x2. Very small portions.

_AAzQeNJ4E2HIxM50qdwBA,Lets just begin by saying this is THE ORIGINAL polish deli in pittsburgh! 25 years I think miss Anna told me they have been in business and still going strong! Alfred's isn't the largest store in the neighborhood but it is definitely QUALITY polish food. What others claim to be ""the best"" around the city is hardly the case.. She sells the most authentic kielbasa you can get! It's seriously amazing..If you want plain jane kielbasa then I suggest shop and save. Canned goods, pierogi, etc!
