ZU6pUJNBGXQZrWD9zEHtuQ,Can't understand who eats here,  place is disgusting.  I'll pay a little more for China lobster right across the street each and every time.  Not to mention China lobsters servers are some of the friendliest around,  they're always smiling, happy and make you feel very welcomed.  Also they're buffet is 13.50 but offers about 5 to 6 huge shrimp selections which are incredible.  I don't know where anyone else is getting unlimited shrimp but I guarantee you aren't getting that here are top China.,2016-05-25,bhHDgSlm4npCdgxYqYHcVw,

AB6xAAxRRVS8tJgbW1aphw,Quality over quantity.  Anyone whining about quantity needs to go to fortune star where you'll find a ton of selections but get mediocre food.  They now have chili shrimp,  fantail fried shrimp,  salt and pepper shrimp,  and a new house shrimp that is similar to general tsos.  There is no Chinese buffet offering that amount of shrimp for dinner, and huge shrimp to boot,  for that price.  It's all you can eat shrimp for under 14 bucks.  I'd pay 20 for this buffet.,2016-06-16,bhHDgSlm4npCdgxYqYHcVw,

D71xljonXjT6KHU_NhgyRA, am so glad you asked. When you drive your car long distances you are doing more than filling your gas tank. You are increasing your mileage and decreasing the value of your car, decreasing the life of your engine, tires and other critical parts, increasing the chances of an accident significantly. It may even seem cheaper on the surface to fill up your tank and go, but as you can see, we are the affordable alternative to costly wear and tear on your car.,2016-01-24,ZomdepTKLXKITg_8GpNCug,
D71xljonXjT6KHU_NhgyRA,Just like in any business, if you provide excellent service, clients prefer to deal with you over others , that's why Autoland of Pittsburgh added few more new trucks and trailers ... are YOU getting your cars and trucks on time ? Most likely not if they are not on our trailers .,2016-10-23,ZomdepTKLXKITg_8GpNCug,

28exW1xiocTHiJIkVY2A9g,No doubt Kennywood as a whole is a dream for Pittsburghers. The only complaint is the garbage food choices and the excessive pricing for the low quality. One change during 2013 was the chicken strips sold at Small Fry. Until this year they were natural strips of chicken breast meat. Now, they switched to processed, preforrmed nuggets. Thanks!  And thanks from the kids who get to enjoy scrap food.  Raise the standards, not just profits.,2013-08-16,FjSDhPEmyjFqj9-BBZ9x-g,

qC7ATMm1D0Y0-G2dxwMYmw,Avoid the shopping center on Steeler Sundays, holidays, and the 4th of July. It is a legit madhouse. People are cutthroat crazy around these times in an already tight parking lot! The 4th of July is an interesting time for this area. They have a parade and if you drive down Brownsville road a few days prior to the 4th , you can see all the chairs people set out to reserve their spot for the parade. I would definitely steer clear of this shopping center a few days before and the day of the 4th.,2014-09-20,l3ryB3Q6WZ3uHDHVe2HgoA,

lK5apgGrWJkB1awSL5twkw,Great prices on meats. It's the only place I buy steaks, pork butts, and hot dogs. Why? Because there are no better hot dogs in town... maybe the world. I have converted at least seven people (one being someone who for at least 35 years has sworn she hates hot dogs) into true believers, the hot dogs are that good. I buy their ny strips for around $3\/lb...granted you have to buy the whole thing but they'll be happy to cut them into 2"" thick steaks. Mmmmmm!,2013-08-13,Klnlj5Z_77o8u43agYrU5g,

7l_ZuvbtQE9AW8dx5NUi0Q,Worst dental experience of my life!  Save yourself time, money and ALOT of pain and find a qualified dentist! They are scam artists and I unfortunately found out why their nickname is the Butcher! I now have to see a specialist in hopes that he can make my mouth look somewhat normal!  I went in for a routine cleaning and was told I needed 2 root canals and an extraction.  Had the extraction done - he ripped the tooth out thru the bone and side of my gums!  I had pain for 3 weeks!  Horrible!!,2014-05-08,ZkfP2Ps6dXUT-qpOFFNxkQ,
7l_ZuvbtQE9AW8dx5NUi0Q,I received a bill from this place for almost $1700.00!  I immediately called and was told that my insurance did not cover any procedures that were performed and myself or my husband!  So I called my insurance company.  Not one claim for the procedures were submitted!  I had to pay $249.00 for a bone graft. My current dentist is not even sure they did a bone graft as I have pretty much no bone where the tooth was extracted.  I will get a refund!!!  Reported to the BBB!!!,2014-05-08,ZkfP2Ps6dXUT-qpOFFNxkQ,
7l_ZuvbtQE9AW8dx5NUi0Q,I was also instructed that I needed to have a ton of root canals done and then crowns would need to be completed.  They also wanted me to return in one week after the extraction to start a bridge for the extracted tooth.  The area needs 6 - 8 weeks to heal before a bridge can be completed.  I went to my new\/old dentist today who told me that I do not need all those root canals!!!  Now I have to see an oral surgeon to see if he can even repair the damage done so I can get a bridge!!!,2014-05-08,ZkfP2Ps6dXUT-qpOFFNxkQ,

My friend ordered the chicken special, good flavor, but dry way oversalted.  I totally enjoyed my  potato pancakes, red cabbage and  wedge salad.  Byob with a 5 dollar corkage fee. Beer fee is 1 dollar per bottle( never heard of this before?)  inexpensive,  some things need ironed out. All in all , decent.,2013-04-13,HluNYgf3sbpCItHXCMpJnQ,

Theb lines are often way too lomg and the parkimg lot is a zoo. The Sheet card system really needs work. They can't look it up by your phone number. While the in store registers can scan a key tag, smart phone, or full sized card, the gas pumps require you to use the full sized wallet card. Very inconvenient.,2014-03-30,KqItBIJXO_UhZ6MktvuI0Q,

It gives a wrong phone number 800-000-000! But worse if (like me) you have it give you directions from the airport it takes you to Westgate Mall 30 minutes away!!

0eqiQ6njUxGcFKYr8CNKkA,Mrs G is black and I am white. We couldn't figure out whether the three (black) staff - 'receptionist' (female) and two staff (male) one upstairs staring down at us and one shooting the breeze with the receptionist in a surly manner - didn't like me because I am white, or us because we are interracial. Either way there was a hostile racial vibe in the air. So much for hospitality. 20 since the lat Holiday Inn stay - will be more than 20 before the next :(,2016-06-15,uVDJlnPJNx07_jDqI4jgYA,

EHKzu5r2NEz5Zq2R84J4ow,Weird experience. Dinner for one, I was treated like a leper. It was 11 minutes before my server came to take my drink order and I ordered my entree at the se time. I had the hot and sour soup which was almost tofu less and was neither hot nor sour. I had the banana pepper beef which was smoky, hot and good. It took forever to get my check. Probably can't recommend.,2014-06-27,ee9X7FcJvSJ2e770gOwWnA,

qrcAGkBi0Qhg0HIfUJBDhg,Well it's just kinda what that other Keith said . It's just another Burger King . Now that location is rather excellent though if you're out grocery shopping with the family and you just wanna grab some dinner  !

DwSFTVUZX0xIE6T54yp2JQ,Well, have lived out here since the 70's when it was just a little place beside Stop'nGo ( Not called Patrick's)  .

brpJ1jYGH_Pgrx7dKIqesA,This is such a fun place for kids and adults. Having a membership is worth it if you have children. Whenever my nephews and nieces visit, we always come here. The laser shows are cool and make sure to have enough time to go to SportsWorks. If you're not claustrophobic, I'd recommend touring the submarine. There are normally lines at SportWorks and those lines close before the whole place closes. The food is just okay. I'd recommend eating before you come or pack a lunch.,2013-08-15,eXC9pqaD21oSet31ZeRG_A,

1l-7nZDdSnSU-CLHDEkSVg,This is my first Yelp check-in at D&M, but I've been here a number of times over the years. Today was the first time I arrived and was told it would be an hour wait.  I returned in an hour and was serviced right away for a pedi. Here's a tip: If getting a mani, pay and tip before your nails are painted.

I'll definitely return.  Friendly folks there. Great customer service and welcoming.,2014-06-27,eXC9pqaD21oSet31ZeRG_A,

ruD4E_OMlfEXTdMV0lDFIg,Dined during the lunch hour and we were seated right away. The wait for the food wasn't long. I couldn't decide between the fish & grits or shrimp & grits.

Then since I'm visiting from Orange County California, I also had to order the pumpkin pancakes. Guess I'm done eating for the day....to the Gym!,2013-09-29,TbtesSnU5j_UKB5MvcY3PQ,
lKom12WnYEjH5FFemK3M1Q,Pretty good sandwich. I had the roast beef with a fried egg and an Iron City Amber to wash it down. Ahh, delish....bring me another one!,2013-09-29,TbtesSnU5j_UKB5MvcY3PQ,
g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ,Wow! This place is incredibly good. I ordered the famous Andy's Sage fried chicken which has spinach, tomatoes, mozzarella, bacon with a chipotle cream sauce on top of smashed potatoes and biscuits and I needed help trying to finish it.....food won! Since I'm not from Las Vegas, I also had to try one pancake (banana brown sugar). Not your regular size pancake, it's prehistoric BIG. Portions are big, so unless you're real hungry and even that's a stretch, share with someone. My co-workers helped.,2013-10-11,TbtesSnU5j_UKB5MvcY3PQ,
YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,Go with your taste buds, so much to choose. For beer they have a flight sampler. Big menu, go with your gut or ask what's the popular choices,2014-04-15,TbtesSnU5j_UKB5MvcY3PQ,
RhEvP5flF6KoPriMHmVYGg,Away from the crowded strip, but oh so close to the beautiful red rock mountains. Plenty of restaurants nearby and some good ones on site. Spa is great and the gym has all the necessities. Shuttle service to the strip,2014-04-17,TbtesSnU5j_UKB5MvcY3PQ,
T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ,Tried the Showgirl dog....It's good, but a little too much relish. I like relish, but maybe a little less with this dog because of the sauerkraut. Don't get me wrong though, the Showgirl was good. Also got some onion rings, very very good! Skip the ranch, I think they use Kraft or some other grocery type, it's watery\/light.,2013-10-08,TbtesSnU5j_UKB5MvcY3PQ,
y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,Don't let the plethora of beers full you, this place has pretty good food. But, back to beer....they have a few samplers (flights of beer) or ask for a taste of a few to get exactly what you want. Bartenders are cool and again, food is good,2014-04-17,TbtesSnU5j_UKB5MvcY3PQ,
y8d90Pt16Nip-B5UXWBP-w,Bartenders are super cool, ask them for suggestions. Friday night was noisy, but then again, what's wrong with that. Cool toons,2014-04-18,TbtesSnU5j_UKB5MvcY3PQ,

The beef was a little overcooked with medium, but it was still tender enough and flavorful. The rainbow trout, which apparently equals salmon in Canada, was good too. Chocolate cake was better than the creme brûlée,2017-07-21,IWFWaJZC8tBPMVPcoPNSdA,

The New York steak with a little disappointing because it was a bit tough.

The carabinero was reportedly very tasty, not to mention the unique sherry ritual. The lavraki (sea bream) was very good. The Chocolate Sin cake was a great finish. The tuna tartar was forgettable. For the price, the service was very lacking.,2017-04-29,IWFWaJZC8tBPMVPcoPNSdA,
FJMMPL3pxAPYGEPB0Hwlhw,Had the Summerlicious lunch menu. The soup and the ravioli were ok to start. The trout looked and tasted essentially like salmon, which was fine. The chocolate cake and budino were pretty good,2017-07-21,IWFWaJZC8tBPMVPcoPNSdA,
lTixk1IT-D4hoMZ6LgoyHQ,The lobster Mac and cheese was as good as others reviewed. The fois gras was a little disappointing, even after they switched out the initial cold one.

igHYkXZMLAc9UdV5VnR_AA,Was getting really excited about the ribeye cap, but it turned out only okay. Fortunately, they switched it to the skirt steak, which is much more flavorful and made the experience much better.

qNSZpcyoF7OM6g49sAFUcQ,I went there for brunch this weekend. The menu itself consisted of unnecessary complicated twists on traditional brunch items, I'm assuming to appeal to more hipster crowds (i.e. see hipster Benedict on the menu). The menu just makes you ask yourself instead, ""which food will I probably hate the least"". I got French toast and a couple of them weren't even cooked the whole way. It was mush on the inside, very unsafe since it was uncooked egg. I can confidently say I will not be going there again.,2017-07-09,w0utfon2BcRsKdwp3Bty3Q,
