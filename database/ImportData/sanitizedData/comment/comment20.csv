sS_ZjpOQ2bMkPoKa5ikmDg,Since 1976, this sleek restaurant across the street from Marché Jean-Talon has enticed diners with the tingle of sumac and pomegranate. The mouhamara and filet mignon in spicy terbialy sauce have reached cult status for a reason. #TastingTable,2015-06-25,T4KMWeEjqXECsfG6r6Mjzg,
Wb9VqNZCq-ZgIlhb4ZDT5A,You might start your meal with seaweed ""tapenalgue"" or cheese, zucchini and grasshopper mousse, but this cheeky bistro is best known for its poutine flavored with house-made seal merguez. Order the wackiest delicacy on the chalkboard menu or settle in for a steak. #TastingTable,2015-06-25,T4KMWeEjqXECsfG6r6Mjzg,

MjWwjPErWyFU9nv6NQKYgA,Much of the menu at this classic Romanian steakhouse has transformed little since its 1938 inception. That ice cream scoop of chopped liver may be presented with a modern, haute plating, but classics like verenikas and karnatzlach remain unchanged. #TastingTable,2015-06-25,T4KMWeEjqXECsfG6r6Mjzg,

ByFBnl90Nr2T7UUwoDQ42g,Ever fantasized about the Paris Julia Child encountered in the 1950s? It breathes on at this 1956 bistro time capsule. Start with homemade rillettes or a cassolette of escargot--but remember that you must order a fluffy île flottante. #TastingTable,2015-06-25,T4KMWeEjqXECsfG6r6Mjzg,
mmazCP1ZH0QsUqDS6OivFA,One of the toughest reservations in town is this temple to excess. The chalkboard menu changes constantly, but standards, including an infernally indulgent lobster spaghetti, are worth pairing with surprises, such as cornflake-crusted eel nuggets. The same owners are also behind the neighboring Liverpool House and no-reservations wine bar Le Vin Papillon. #TastingTable,2015-06-25,T4KMWeEjqXECsfG6r6Mjzg,
r3Yj3Vc_FOdRfZ4Q4Ei2Eg,This tiny eatery can be hard to find, but its hand-pulled noodles are worth the search. They're made into meaty soups and spicy tangles of cucumber and beef. Don't miss the roujiamo, a dish of pulled pork on rice bread that traces its ancestry back to 1045 BC. #TastingTable,2015-06-25,T4KMWeEjqXECsfG6r6Mjzg,

Sad for Danielle that she is not a professional, has not studied her profession, and doesn't realize that women are generally far better tippers than men.

And the woman who took my order was angry that I couldn't understand her. While I ate another elderly woman was mopping at my table and asked me to move so she could finish. Not to mention 20 screaming children, none of their parents spoke English so I couldn't ask them to keep their kids away from my table like it was a game.

My tip is to call first to make sure you're on the actual schedule. I'm assuming this appointment feature is new so they haven't figured everything out. Overall, highly recommend.,2016-12-10,9oHMdDcXdtUjVaAokRrjsg,

The Gorganzola Bleu Cheese dressing on the salad was fantastic as was the Chicken Parmigiana Alfredo. Crisp, pounded chicken breasts over fettucini was simply amazing. Atmosphere akin to 'bar scene' in Goodfellas...Frank, Dean on the jukebox, darkened interior, obviously a local joint but service was good and friendly and I sure won't wait another 20 years to go back.,2013-04-06,tNHyMRIcW7sCrD_d7emCDQ,

Eggs Benedict, crab Benedict, Belgium waffle, French toast, and wings & waffles on the menu.  I just had the Clevelander (eggs, bacon\/sausage, potatoes, toast). Potatoes were ok - tasted like leftover baked potatoes.  But not a bad place for a quick breakfast.,2014-06-15,XQ9AMIjaWyqJmKSQeM3AOA,

mYFVOkv4UgtRaS3xMY-tvA,Went here several years ago and we were meeting friends recently and this was a good half way point to do so.  Upon entering on a Friday after work we sat at a table (and there are few tables) and waited. Eventually went to the bar only to be told there is no table service.  We were having food so that was a slight problem.   The food here is actually good but it seems like they really could care less if you eat here.  One other couple walked in  and since nobody came to the table they left.,2016-12-31,R-Yp8T-0BAdO4KQ_ODE92w,
OF19lUVQHj8pVaSACNewWg,Disappointed this time.  Went for anniversary dinner before and it was fabulous.  Tried for a birthday dinner recently and was sorely disappointed.  Service was horrible.  Took forever to get drinks and our server was mediocre at best.  Wasn't terribly busy so was at a loss to figure out why.  Felt bad for wait staff as they had to bus their own tables.  Hire a bus person.  Maybe then servers can concentrate on the patrons.,2016-12-12,R-Yp8T-0BAdO4KQ_ODE92w,
-PnZ5_XurjYgoqIKd3p1RA,We went here on opening weekend and I am surprised that they are still open.  Food was mediocre at best.

I thought my aunt was going to have a stroke over that one.,2017-05-13,R-Yp8T-0BAdO4KQ_ODE92w,

Well, apparently counting isn't required, only 10 in a twelve pack and to top it off they didn't even have the right amount of soft and hard. The potato grillers were burnt and impossible to chew. The only thing that worked was the drinks. Guess it's hard to mess that up. What an epic failure.,2015-11-05,k4FLgThOaqbtFu6OExYbHg,

L2p0vO3fsS2LC6hhQo3CzA,Every time I  here the food amazes....scrambled eggs that are light and fluffy, and waffles that are just enough flour to hold the eggs and butter together: slightly crisp on the outside and light as air inside. As good as anywhere in Brooklyn can offer, and you get Phoenix's equivalent of hipsters thrown in the mix as well. Always a favorite spot here.,2014-01-05,6r179RwRAXfV04yaVqORFw,

y8xW4Ps3bmVnswKdSdtB3Q,Julie Asst. Manager thought it was approciate to call my room I was locked out of early this morning. Waking up my partner. Defeating the purpose of getting a room key from the front desk just so I wouldn't have to wake them up by knocking on the door. I just never experienced someone going through the hoops just for a duplicate key. Nor do I think it was approciate. Bad move there! Bad enough i had to see a messy pillow on the bed upon arrival.

They served me a warm cup of coffee but they exchanged it for a hot cup with a frown and not even a 'sorry bout that'.,2013-06-25,jS0sMHQ3q5HfYPORiDuIzw,

HP5d_9crFG6TkYmcDk7vYQ,Apparently there is no way to reply to the owner's comment once it has been left in response to your review.  The owner stated I filled out a survey form and said the movers did very well.  She failed to mention that this was before I realized the glass door was missing and the other one hadn't been reattached and I was forced to complete the satisfaction survey with the movers standing over me saying they would appreciate all 5s.  A customer should never have to do that.  My tip is ask upfront!,2016-01-05,D2d4dXHo4EhOE14QPCwETA,
HP5d_9crFG6TkYmcDk7vYQ,The movers also took smoke breaks and took 15 minutes to move the truck around, there was no travel time and one of them was on his phone a lot and then stopped to make conversation with me and was not helping his partner.  I don't have any more stuff than most people in that size apt.  I was never quoted a time and they exceeded 6 hours without travel time.

The store is a mess. Walking through the isles there is trash and misplaced items everywhere your eyes land. People need jobs and Wal-Mart is a multi billion dollar company.

XngwPRynytzSPJoVlawnjQ,I love Safeway until now, I was buying some yogurts for my son, the date was Oct 21,2013 and the dates that the yogurts expires was Oct 17,2013...... Really?! A store like Safeway which is not cheap makes a huge mistake.Usually I never look at the expiration date for anything I buy in Safeway, but now I do.Very disappointed.And yes I told the clerk and she didn't even apologize. A lot of kids would've gotten sick if someone didn't catch it.,2013-10-23,WbKGG82fhgqXwkPiUB-PiQ,

PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg,So to clarify, they have two different chicken curries. If you don't specify, they will likely serve you the ""toned down"" version with no spice. I opt for the spicy version. I'm not big on spices, but I found it to be just right. The other one is too bland for me.,2015-04-03,RvXTDScB01DbDaV7XOuE-w,
Xb2e9svDYHH7KhcuAD1jbg,I've sat in several areas of this pub and would say that unless you want some space from everything else, the corner with the TV isn't ideal.

Opt for going into the pharmacy if possible for a more efficient and relaxing experience if the car queue is long. Waiting sucks, but sometimes it's a part of the deal.

vUrphsWuYfAKptZVLqG6ng,This is the worst hotel ever! No Wifi as they claim! In a horrible area and refuse to even give you pillows. Tried to overcharge even though I had already paid through Orbit. I think the Mexican girl at the reception desk is stealing by over charging.,2013-09-25,qemRZEYAoFWoW8rYfchDiw,
vUrphsWuYfAKptZVLqG6ng,This hotel is a terrible place to stay.  The rooms don't include all the amenities and the ones that do have broken appliances. Check out is at 11 and they were knocking on my door at 10. The rooms have been a disaster every time I've stayed. I stay here as a vacation that's home away from home and honestly i would have rather stayed home. If i don't get a discount or a night comped next time i go in it will be my last visit. Oh also the price of the room i rented went up $10 in 3 days,2015-06-23,UYIo-MfZfM-s7CzZ5gAo3g,

Music is loud which definitely helps with awkward silence, lots of bass that literally moves you. Drinks are reasonably priced for the location and compared to other bars nearby. Staff is surprisingly attentive given the volume of people and constant movement and recognize new customers rather quickly. Overall a very fun place to be!,2014-06-10,DJ6KIZ5h_clUqcXvgnJjwA,
