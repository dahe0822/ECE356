Talked to the server, they didn't seem surprise, only asked if we want to exchange to another item, of course no!

Today, being a Saturday, the place was busy but it is a bit annoying that for one person to order desserts, you have to go to one side, and to order the sandwiches you have to go to the opposite side. IMHO it is a bad design, and they have quite a few people working there but it seemed like they themselves do not know which customer to serve first. Other than that, coffee and cakes were good.,2013-04-20,s1XTZINUXibQEfbCvRKBMg,

ZsA4JEarDfSf-U5mYbXtJg,Brunch ends exactly at 11am... come any later and they will only serve you lunch items! Pavlova (Russian dessert - meringue with whipped cream and various fruit toppings) sounds simple and overly sweet and though they say it is a shareable dessert, it has just the right amount of sweetness (not too sweet at all but surprisingly refreshing) you're going to want one all for yourself then maybe get a second one to share!,2016-06-08,OnQy9hlYzOPbPcs9iledYA,

B01pO_pI_8AOfEsukGNg-Q,If you ever see a whiteboard with a handwritten item under the menu, get it! Depending on what's available in the market, the chef sometimes makes a special dish not on the menu and it's ALWAYS amazing! If you're not big on spice, tell her and she can recommend something from the menu for you.  If they have the beef soup, try it! Very simple but delicious - it tastes like home!!!,2017-05-14,OnQy9hlYzOPbPcs9iledYA,

I do have to mention that there is NO independent washroom!!! You have to go all the way down into the sketchy dirty basement washroom that is shared with the McDonald's next door. In the summer you can sit out in the sun facing Charles which is nice to do while reading a book and sipping a cold beverage,2015-05-05,syQQ4lhCqKl12Uc30vPbBQ,

The manicure was really good and they had tons of colours to choose from. The only downside was that they didn't massage my hands at all, but I guess that's fine. Overall a clean, friendly and great salon to go to!!! :),2013-12-29,7DjD9A_D66bzJvheaw4xbw,

bRntmjztJ4dFDA_LYiEECw,Great place for a fun night with a group of friends. The food\/drinks aren't anything out of the ordinary, but they suffice. Go here for the large variety of board games as it's a good place to chill out with a small\/large group. Wait times are not too bad if you get here around 6pm.. Gets busier later! $5 cover is just for having access to the games, and another $8-$10 allows for a nice snack\/drink. Parking is available on the streets.,2014-01-08,7DjD9A_D66bzJvheaw4xbw,

cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw,Food is authentic and well prepared. Customer service and ambience are not their strongest point, and more often than not they have messed up our take-out order, plus haven't been apologetic about it. We usually order the BBQ platter which is approx $40 and comes with a variety of kebabs, fish pakoras, chicken tikka and naan. It's a decent sized platter and can easily feed a family of 4. Not recommended for dine in as the interiors are pretty run down. Go here only for the yummy kebabs!!,2013-12-29,7DjD9A_D66bzJvheaw4xbw,
coaJ-kPzfKmtp_0kXIbISA,I had seen the reviews prior to my appt and kind of knew what I was to expect given I had a groupon. Another customer (also with a groupon) was being helped before me and the person said the same thing to her - your car is too soiled and there is dog hair everywhere! When I called him out on this, he started misbehaving and raising his voice. I had I unfortunately do the same and let him know that his scam of a business is exposed!! I will surely be contacting groupon for a refund! Ridiculous!!,2013-12-28,7DjD9A_D66bzJvheaw4xbw,

MOST if not ALL bridal boutiques are by appointment only. The nicest boutiques I've been to have to be buzzed to unlock the front door for you cause they don't even want you in there without an appointment.

SqTAlszocy9n2ExQWRVSgg,Naans, haleeem, chicken biryani, and reshmi kababs are the highlights of this place.,2014-11-17,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ,Variety of different appetizers and main course food. Their appetizers,  salad bar, and some main course items are greatttt , but desserts and sweets are stale and horrible.  Very affordable place... just stay away from desserts bar.,2015-01-25,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
TQcDrdS8Dbbrayu78G_myA,Order naans, Haleem, and lamb biryani. You won't regret it. Their chicken seekh kababs are good too, but not comparable to Shaheen Tikka and Kabab house.  Still very tasty. Very nice environment for families to sit and enjoy their food, as this is the only desi restaurant in GTA that is free of semi-nude and sexual bollywood song videos.,2015-01-25,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
BvRYdhStop6veX2SsRkqIA,Order Nihaari, Haleem, chicken seekh kabab, butter till naan, and if it's a weekend Halwa puri and paaya.,2014-11-15,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
1fI_kmr2uteywk_i-Nboag,The best Falafal in the entire GTA. Please go early in the afternoon cuz their stuff is sold out quickly.,2015-01-22,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,

HNjuGzWT0O9Xk_9q_9HF3g,Filthy place... never go there please.,2015-01-27,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w,Worst restaurant in the history of mankind. This place is not for Lahori food lover (whatta shame their name is Lahore Tikka) . They are only famous for butter chicken which shouldn't be the caliber to rank ANY restaurant sooo high. BTW butter chicken is not authentic Pakistani food any ways.   Overhyped and over-rated by non-desi ppl. PERIOD.,2014-11-18,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
oo73pe5tERpDxaa_eSY2tQ,Kid size portions for adults.  Overpriced stuff.,2014-11-19,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
GdCRQU3VCh_x8fY84mbwYQ,Excellent food, huge portion , a bit pricey.  Sultani kabab dinner is the best in my opinion. Don't waste your money on dessert called ""firni"" cuz it's shame to call it by this name. They have just mixed up milk with corn starch and brought to a boil.,2015-01-20,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
8XMsPxPtJ72cXqmTSaaQVg,Imagine any grocery item from Pakistan and only one name pops up that is Iqbal Halal food. Kachnaar, moongray, singhaaray, guava, knorr soups, knorr yakhni, everyday milk ... you name it. A bit far in the East end, but once in a while it doesn't hurt.,2015-01-22,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
7PeHmWoovUlH8pK6tJNn8A,Don't order quarter chicken because it's always pink inside. Order chicken skewer instead. I actually only like to eat from JImmy the Greek if I am at Yorkdale. The portion size isn't that great though.,2015-01-21,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
Jq60uSolPAPJKXulKzyP4Q,Very rude staff with no manners.  Go to Bengali sweets just across the street for same items that have better flavor and  better customer service.,2015-01-22,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
YAdyu9ovEiOZXBWkD0H8-Q,Bland food... mostly dehydrated due to sitting in burners for a long time. All fried items for some reason are left on burner-less sort of huge table kinda platters therefore those items are cold. Falafels, veggies items, meat items are semi-cold . I donno why would u waste $30 bucks per person. Not to mention the semi nude dancer that burns ur eyes. Save your money for something better.,2015-01-27,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
FlOvCwPUrRCicfbpd1tUIQ,Here is a tip for you: save your money for some better restaurant.  This place serves horrible food and the customer service is ridiculous.,2015-01-12,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
fwXKszT6j_f6pf0tp3MHLw,Saturday mornings have the best variety.  Never mind the long drive. I mean their each baklava item is a piece of heaven. I have tried almost 20 different stores and 20 different kinds of bakla in Ontaro  i.e. Turkish, Lebanese,  Iranian, Iraqi,  Afghan ... but this is the place if you want to imagine what the fruits of heaven might taste like.,2015-01-22,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
LTO9FnQ9WtnqA9j9hYwNmA,Seriously forget about any other place just eat here if you are in the food court. Their portion is HUGE.,2015-09-07,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
M3VcPBiMvhsEJSGUHvXu2w,Excellent food with lots of flavor, great potion sizes, reasonable actually very reasonable prices compared to stupid Paramount that has no taste and pricy for no reason. Order anything from the menu and you are gonna love it. I am glad that finally I have found a middle eastern restaurant that really serves food with aroma, flavors,  and spices.  Word of caution: They only have Beef\/lamb and no chicken item what so ever; therefore, it may not be suitable for everyone. No tax.,2015-01-16,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
LAUdAyDlUppGDjWop2ytMg,Bland food... mostly dehydrated due to sitting in burners for a long time. All fried items for some reason are left on burner-less sort of huge table kinda platters therefore those items are cold. Falafels, veggies items, meat items are semi-cold . I donno why would u waste $30 bucks per person. Not to mention the semi nude dancer that burns ur eyes. Save your money for something better.,2015-01-17,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
cBsbRURKtG6sqbjwQ5TvoA,Amazing French food with beautiful and elegant ambience.,2015-01-24,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
0Mhw1lD_Zwsv4Vo6oQrPWA,Order the following items and your taste buds would praise you: chow mein noodles, egg fried rice with chilli chicken, deep fried shrimps, crab (this portion is huge and you need a group of people to share), hot and sour soup. Food is just amazing . Never mind the dark and shady sitting area LOL. No free parking cuz it's downtown Toronto.,2015-01-22,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
CzwowIhuiBfW9O0MqUJhKA,Also, make sure to tell them ""I DO NOT WANT BURNT NAANS""  . This place has a tendency to serve you burned naans.,2014-11-17,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
CzwowIhuiBfW9O0MqUJhKA,Order chicken seekh kabab, naan, haleem,  and lamb biryani. Do not order combos. Order kababs in 2, 4 , 5 , 6 quantity and buy the naans separate. Ask for Can of Pop rather than fountain drink which tastes so disgusting without CO2 and diluted.,2014-11-17,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
3fisVoVAdjVqhbzT5GYkYQ,Just spend your money some where else that is closer in this area. The place is filthy and I mean it (their kitchen is pretty visible behind the counter) Horrible place with buffet style food sitting on burners God knows for how long. Curry items are ridiculously expensive. Halwa puri plate is OK. Nothing really special. Again, it is a take out place so where are you going to eat puri halwa in your car.,2015-05-19,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
ZPhQyUO9MY5xNEcTqZOrTQ,Must try: gulam jamun, moti choor laddu, paneer pakora, namak paaray and samosay. Avoid: Chaat pappri because chick peas are hard enough to give you tummy pain.,2014-11-17,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
ZPhQyUO9MY5xNEcTqZOrTQ,By far, the best sweets\/mithaii in all of Ontario. Gulab jamun, moti choor laddu, coconut barfi, gajar halwa barfi all are great. I have never tried other food except of  chaat papri once. It was horrible because chick peas were hard like rock which gave me horrible tummy pain instantly.,2014-11-17,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
hcH1Njh_YMP3IHQopGAvcA,Order only desserts and do not expect them to guide you while making your selection.  You are on your own, as their employees are mostly rude and very self-absorbed. Ànd please do take out because this place reminds me of gloomy and haunted hallways of St . Joseph Health Center's (old site). (You know what I mean ...),2015-11-19,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,
qhKNZTtTT6GLnPzQny-v9Q,Don't  just don't order food from here and I mean it. We do eat from Tandoori Time, Karachi kitchen, Patna Kabab house,  and Shaheen quite frequently and we know what NORMAL food should  taste like. Every restaurant in this age and time offer three levels of spiciness MILD, MEDIUM,  & HOT; where as, this place offers only one kind. HOT like hell. My husband and I both got sick from the spiciness and piles upon piles of visible traces of green chilli which you can't sperate from ur food. Horrible,2015-11-11,_NT4K3xZNt8qa_SXGVOXmg,

HU8MnV129kOK4m0ZH4GpCg,Watch out!!! Went here on Friday with my girl friend and a friend and they served us drinks using lime juice that stated April 6th on the bottle when it was April 15th. Lime juice shouldn't be out or refrigerated for more than 24 hours. Luckily my drink didn't have any of the lime juice but my 2 guest did and they had some stomach issues for the next 2 days. Also the diced limes stated March 23rd on them. Not sure this is a healthy issue, but I am going to think twice about going back.,2017-04-16,j57-tOoZZWhEMJ0kzOmJIg,

yADOyFmSlHuixlQ4MtHhcQ,Had an enjoyable breakfast here a few weeks ago. The food was standard for breakfast: eggs, toast, meat (sausages were good), and homefries. The server was pleasant and funny.

Went late one night after dinner and not only was the service terrible and unwelcoming (she looked like she wanted nothing more than for us to get out of the shop and treated us with a terrible attitude), but the ice cream was average and the hot fudge wasn't hot fudge.

Nip4TJZjarrZv2lrPA0YBw,It is the worst airport limo service. I called the cab around 4:20. Their policy allows a waiting time of 10 minutes. I was inside the cab at 4:27 PM. The driver said extra charge. called the customer service at 4:28. He stated the policy, I said I am calling u from inside the cab at 4:28. He said if u can afford $5, which I am sure you cannot afford, pay it. It was not about the money but abt the principle. At the airport the driver said, ""you're this nationality right"" u people are like this.,2014-11-16,5AVvHcmTWjwutHn9c0Ibow,

IKRh-Kzh2UExFGif5zoiFw,The AYCE is expensive for what you get. Service is slow & portions are small for AYCE, so you are ordering very often. Despite the grill in the middle of the table, AYCE is cooked by the chef in the back. For the price, go to Markham and have a better, cheaper meal. Even if you factor in fuel cost.,2013-02-09,SyJpfxH2kTMWyAr8Zr8x1A,
QIYNDLfNr1fuD8hKoq_qNg,Despite having food readily available under heat lamps, the mismanagement of the staff shows very well. Took nearly 10 minutes at 2PM to get my meal. Very inefficient team here,2014-08-13,SyJpfxH2kTMWyAr8Zr8x1A,

wvtN91zHpfL5Ku_TBhMSHA,I do not recommend this Salon for hair styling at all. Perhaps the cuts are good but I came in to get my hair curled for an engagement and ended up with curls that last 20 minutes. Within an hour my hair fell flat, no crown volume whatever and some loose curls at the bottom. I have short shoulder length hair and for 45 dollars and no wash I felt completely ripped off as the hair style looked worse than something someone would do by themselves at home. Terrible experience.,2014-07-02,IZb02ZGJVm1qsd0K5hv2qA,

tvxI5iRImLnPdLbiI1HXhA,Been there 3  times and 2 of those visits they had no honey wheat bread for a tuna sandwich. The sandwich is advertised with honey wheat. Don't they make their own bread? Disappointing and ridiculous to say the least.,2014-07-26,c20CSFktkND_d3ADp63zvQ,

8hfP-Lt2hvWAm5j-C2KPjA,Using mix chicken instead of breast. Added a tahini-like sauce without asking. You don't put anything but garlic in a chicken shawarma.,2015-05-14,KnuJECEefxIvzOHbsxbwGg,

1_rqZz1K5Uoq2RvZlINfgA,Always busy line-ups here! As soon as you enter, go the cash counter, give your number for seating and ask for a # on a paper slip and go back to the line up until they call your #.

It will always be our pleasure to make our sushi the best we can offer, to ours and your expectations!,2016-05-17,l0jvsLqYlK3ukuoelXeQIw,
IDJwHQqQePBqIWX3723Ing,Hello my name is Sam Kim and I am 1 of the owners of Sora Sushi.  I just wanted to clarify to all sushi connoisseurs that we are a small ""A la carte"" style restaurant\/take-out place.  We strongly believe in using quality ingredients while providing great proportions.  For instance, our sushi rice is marinated with traditional ingredients from Japan.  Eventhough cost of ingredients from Japan are expensive, we've been using the same formula since 1998 and cannot change our formula we believe in,2013-09-13,l0jvsLqYlK3ukuoelXeQIw,

WjIcWWRLVrpdKCL3hz_ofQ,Went to this Dennys for dinner and had good food but poor service even when it wasn't that busy. Took way too long to be greeted,  the food order arrived incorrect and was NEVER asked how the food was. The server was too busy talking to other customers about how long they were a server and how good they were. It doesn't matter how long you are doing something,  doesn't make you good at it!,2014-07-30,6CaVkX1Sodx7eSAUHSqlRg,

Flips: please put up a sign to stop people from coming in who are wearing toxic fragrances.

I'd recommend starting with the ""lighter"" Japanese selections (sashimi and sushi), and then moving on to some hot protein dishes (BBQ beef, calamari, maybe a noodle dish with some chicken, and then the heavier dishes such a butter chicken, Thai curries or the seafood casserole.

NO garnishes on any of our drinks, daiquiri was extremely sweet, waitress was too occupied with other employees, and we asked for water and never received that.

WYg4LRnFd_t9GhsmqZ4pfg,The only reason I got my BMW from Budds is because it's close to my house.  In terms of Value, you're not going to get any here.  Sales reps are good but the dealership will Nickel and dime you every step of the way.  The worst part of my experience is when they made a mistake in applying my car protection package and instead of correcting the mistake they defended it, when I challenged them on it they made excuses for their mistakes.

RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w,Everything was served on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils! The people running this place obviously don't care about how cheap that looks. For the cost of the food it doesn't measure up. Also, bad for the environment!,2013-03-25,y4vij0YTlyTC_1yTvdcuMQ,

FxgLF1XdpaVZbfMwz8iMfA,Very small older LCBO, and quite cramped to walk around in. Not much selection, either. I suppose it's alright if you're in a pinch, but I'd advise to avoid this location if possible. On the bright side, there's a large parking lot.,2013-08-11,y4vij0YTlyTC_1yTvdcuMQ,

a1anU36vAuQdC8IIiOSBRg,Make sure to ALWAYS check the expiry dates on the products here. I've gone home several times with items that are past their expiry dates because I haven't been careful enough. They're not very vigilant about that.,2013-08-16,y4vij0YTlyTC_1yTvdcuMQ,
HP8mkVdLa9F4Amsp2thKhQ,Order ahead for less of a wait, because it could be a considerable wait. This location is very busy and doesn't have much room for waiting on the premises (edit: there is loads of space for eating here. First time I visited, I didn't notice the second room to the right).  Also, limited parking in the tiny plaza lot. I also noticed that they put more rice in their burritos here than they do at the Adelaide location where I'm used to going.

oiLIeEuEDc26pf5q73uwYw,It is what it is... But it's also the best food court sushi I've had, and it's quick and easy to grab and go when you just want a quick fix. I've never been to the sit-down restaurant. Free miso soup when the sushi is full price, and $1.25 extra when it's 30% off at the end of the day.,2013-07-15,y4vij0YTlyTC_1yTvdcuMQ,

qHd3cx8TRj5-VXIUJY-rLQ,Best veggie burgers and value for your money! There are 8 soy-based veggie burgers to a box for $8.99 and they are quite good. Usually you get 4 burgers to a package from other stores and they're $7.99 or so.,2013-08-16,y4vij0YTlyTC_1yTvdcuMQ,
piZ4JqJI5WTljJuQV7yZHQ,The music in here is turned up pretty loud. Definitely more of a 'good times' sort of place to go with friends rather than a quiet date place. Also, there is nothing on the menu for a pescatarian to eat except for fried tofu and salmon roe on rice (Ikura Don). Every soup has a base of pork bone.,2013-02-11,y4vij0YTlyTC_1yTvdcuMQ,
azZ_FAErOlrCtBzU_EBoVg,Really good selection of pet foods and accessories, and often several dollars cheaper than the larger chain pet store in the area. Staff are very friendly, too!,2013-03-25,y4vij0YTlyTC_1yTvdcuMQ,

DE89UdHFMCN6DtYWZuer5A,Vegetarians\/Vegans\/Pescatarians beware - there is no such thing as ramen without a meat base. You won't be able to eat anything here.,2013-02-13,y4vij0YTlyTC_1yTvdcuMQ,
SUkZaH4gzgemZ6BZyAo1vw,No bagels or food other than donuts and tea biscuits here.,2013-04-19,y4vij0YTlyTC_1yTvdcuMQ,
