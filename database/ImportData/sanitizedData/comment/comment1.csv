1gJPuCAJC4CfPSUcGZl9QA,With this being the only local chain that keeps their menu fresh and up to date it is busy with a long wait during the evening and weekends. Food is good service has been above average with one exception which is the hostess station. The youngsters at the hostess station are not very attentive they consistently take elderly or visibly handicapped guests to hightops then are disgusted when customers ask for more suitable accommodations.

Although I do appreciate the generous amount of toppings on the pizza, I did not care for the fact that there was a puddle of water and grease in the middle of my pizza. the crust was not cooked in the middle and the pizza was warm at best after a five minute drive to my house. The breadsticks were nothing but rolled up dough with garlic on top. I don't feel a one-and-a-half topping pizza with bread sticks was worth $33.,2013-08-03,eNWeP3wU94Mp6jcRFD5ipA

GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,Looks and feels like Mario Batali's Osteria Mozza (LA), but Osteria is significantly better while B&B is a lot like many Vegas high-end restaurants (looks the part but too pricey for the just okay quality).,2014-01-11,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ

LLPjL6EGrtsBlYOfZbhuqA,Nice enough Courtyard (and similar to the other Courtyards out there) but an odd location inside a shopping plaza (though I believe the Courtyard near me in Marina Del Rey is also located in a shopping plaza).,2013-06-22,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ

Xy7PVlK8GxQc4d7bXtEqQw,This sorta shopping mall is incredibly small.  It is worth nothing that 2 Top Chef Masters restaurants are located here (Hubert Keller's Burger Bar and Rick Moonen's RM Seafood) and the sports memorabilia shop occasionally showcases former athletes signing autographs like Gale Sayers.,2014-01-06,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ

XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q,The food is extravagant here (right down to the unfathomably elaborate mignardises trolley), but similar extravagant fine dining places like Cyrus and The French Laundry are far superior.,2012-09-04,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q,Their bread trolley and mignardises trolley are both top notch, but I prefer Joel Robuchon's L'atelier next door for upscale French food (much more creative and contemporary).,2014-01-11,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
JmVHS1JtH7MfyAmDOqGmCQ,Celebrity sighting: Stan Lee having the breakfast buffet and discussing with fans the early days of Spider-Man.  He might be in town for the Yankees game; the breakfast buffet provides a view of the interior of the stadium (like being in a luxury box).,2014-08-30,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
JmVHS1JtH7MfyAmDOqGmCQ,Attached to Rogers Centre; the lounge provides a view of the interior of the stadium; you can watch the Blue Jays play from here.,2014-08-31,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
yiU-3I-amn5_ACEzuWHglw,Rogers Centre was probably modern when it first opened, but it now feels incredibly dated.,2014-08-31,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ,Their mixologist is quite gifted and very knowledgeable with the ability to whip up complex concoctions on the fly; she is also, if it is important to you, incredibly attractive.,2014-08-31,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ,They offer two tasting menus--a short but still fairly elaborate one and an extravagant 10-course tasting (though much more when you add in all of their many bonus mini courses).  Their 10-course tasting reveals one excellent course after another as well as so many premium ingredients including lobster, truffle, dry-aged rib cap, and foie gras.,2014-08-31,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ,Their canapés service is among the best I have experienced--not just in quantity and variety but also quality. Lots of great flavor and texture combinations as well as only one or two slight misses.,2014-08-31,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ,Though the head chef has been here over 10 years, the food feels very contemporary and reminds me of some of America's best restaurants--extravagant canapés service (Quince), oysters and caviar (The French Laundry), innovative fish courses that incorporate lesser used parts of the fish (Saison), Asian ingredients in desserts (Manresa), refined cooking techniques with vegetables (Ink), and a well thought out cocktail list (like the many great Chicago spots including Acadia and Blackbird).,2014-08-31,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ

w9elq4MdEzTPX7CSPXHQHw,I am not sure if this is the case with all Fairfields, but the A\/C units at this location and the one in Beachwood never got the room cool enough.,2012-06-22,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,Their breakfast is expensive but good.,2012-01-15,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
klddGAcNIpE_aB5sd1hNXw,Their pain au chocolat was nowhere near as good as my last visit 1-2 years ago; the steak and egg sliders were still decent though the bottom muffin buns were soggy (unappetizing).,2014-01-11,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg,Rooms are not as nice as what you get at The Cosmopolitan and the hotel lacks The Cosmopolitan's hot restaurants, bars and club, but the rooms feature great amenities and consistently come at a much lower rate.,2014-01-06,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ

NCFwm2-TDb-oBQ2medmYDg,Some Cosmopolitan rooms provide balcony views of this show.,2011-01-09,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
NCFwm2-TDb-oBQ2medmYDg,Very touristy but probably a must visit if you have never been to Vegas. Shows run every 15 minutes (the fountains do not run late at night or in the morning).,2014-01-06,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ

dcqHjnmKPDdOseYEo6SdAw,The storefront photo here (an image of the Mastro's Ocean Club) is very fitting. Interesting architecture throughout Crystals and this might be the most defining and unique piece.,2014-01-06,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
N7yuiiu8jhQ-Fl9Npflreg,Their chicken wings are good and their Pad Thai has a good amount of heat to it; some of their entrees and their beef satay are not that great and prices are high.,2014-01-10,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ
C46F7dUN4V8ihdlSOHKN7w,The Blue Jays play at Rogers Centre and draw a lively crowed decked out in blue gear.,2014-08-31,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ

7Oht41Pn7Knb46BRFR1FpA,If they don't have your pet's food on the shelf, ask if they have it in stock in the back. If they don't have the size you want in stock at all, ask if they will price match a number of the smaller bags to the size of the bag you want. For example, they price matched three of the 5 lb bags of dog food to the one 15 lb bag that I wanted but they didn't have in stock. Normally the 5lb bags are $12.99 each and the 15 lb bag is $24.99. So with the price match I got three 5 lb bags for $24.99.,2015-05-22,yiKkxcuQdB04PVUW7OgtNw

pu7maVMRHbIUv2x3B_xMHQ,I read about an impersonable  server here, and I think we had her. Debbie is in the service industry, yet you wouldn't know it from her rough persona.

So the tip is to avoid Debbie as your server if you can. At a higher end resort restaurant, you'd expect top notch servers... Sorry, but she's just not very friendly.

Bought it and realized after buying it that it wouldn't fit in our hatchback car even with our seats laid down, we stated we would come back tomorrow with our truck and they said no, we had to take it then. We brought it home, up to flights of stairs to our apt,  only to find it was missing screws and had to take back the entire thing and they refused to take it back without the box.,2013-03-08,fp1DBn7WMjENnYsqAOBJYg

There was no music inside the restaurant before 7pm either, so all I heard was children screaming. Food was great, but the atmosphere was lacking inside and it was a kid party outside.

The rotisserie style chicken did not disappoint, and the yucca fries were fantastic!

aO1gAp41n8w8zpxTiHdLNA,On June 25, 2015 at approximately 1230 pm I was at Mertz Soul Food Restaurant. I ordered 3 piece chicken wing dinner. The order was to go. When I got home I noticed that the chicken had not been cleaned, there were little pieces on feathers of on the edge on the wings. I pulled what I thought to be feather, and it was long blonde hair that cooked into the skin of chicken. Just the sight of me pulling the blonde hair from the chicken cause me to almost vomit.,2015-07-09,0PLXe_gj5FwMTuiYqJnsXw
