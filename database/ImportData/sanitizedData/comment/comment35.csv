W8apgXmOxESpoL_EeogC5w,One Tip - NEVER GO TO THIS TERRIBLE PLACE. FOOD IS HORRIBLE (Frozen then de-frosted taste and smell), SERVICE IS EVEN WORSE. NO JAPANESE CHEF AT THIS JAPANESE NOODLE SHOP! ANYONE can look into their Open Kitchen and see there are only 4 Hispanic Cooks in the kitchen and that is it. No wonder their Japanese dishes tastes ABSOLUTELY NOT Japanese! The waitresses all speaks and acts as everyone in the world owes them money. No one cares to go there any more and they are losing all of their business.,2017-02-25,FQqcrXf8PbV3n3lJn2pxAA

Today while taking a walk with two yellow labs we were surrounded by 4 children ages 3 to 6 and both Rocky and Honey sat there on command and let the children pet, talk and walk around them. It was the best distraction test yet and the dogs passed with amazing results. Thank you Bob so much as we now have well-behaved dogs in public after 3 lessons.,2016-03-20,Il8MN95AbJQhdpvTOCGrYw

The toasted bun was freshly toasted like during the Vietnam War and if taken though Tsa, would constitute a weapon it was so stale and hard.  The sauce was primarily worchestershire based.

You will be truly dissatified w\/ the customer service from the property management & the way they do business. Sarah, Property Manager, condescending & does not return phone calls as she states she would. Wendy, Agent, constantly rude & unresponsive. Rebecca, Agent, condescending & slow to respond.

ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,If you park in the covered garage on a weekday, you can get your parking ticket validated for the first hour so you'll usually won't have to pay anything out of pocket. If you park on the weekend, however, the city raises the parking fees by a few cents. So after having MTO validate your parking ticket, you'll end up paying 75 cents out of pocket for the first hour on a weekend. You can also try to find street parking as well.,2014-06-02,4QmQi3dNNVBRoclybsHACw

I had a family of 10  and 4 people had real silverware forks and the rest had the very cheap flimsy plastic forks. Try eating that with the pork chops. And at 1 pm the run out of thai tea?.

10RFV-vuQ52VUkmzFXbWaA,2nd time here.Totally, utterly disappointed. We ordered 7 tapas which were delivered within 5-10 minutes, all together. Now you must be thinking why is a fast service a bad thing.. Well, because the food was cold, was sitting pre made, microwaved and sent out. I kid you not, the beef skewers were warm outside and COLD inside.. Same with salmon croquettes, the shrimps too. Fried calamari was probably killed alive in salt cuz, thats how salty it was. Cherry on top, the waiter had terrible BO!,2013-07-21,rgiG41eduynCPPqGywgj8g

f6CTsNX30XmC8siHWYV2bA,I love a good strong massage and prefer skill over strength. Sadly, most of the therapists are not certified and have poor technique. Ive had 4 really bad rubs in a row @ Bali. One man literally pressed so hard he hit nerves and rubbed bones. Nd a lady rubbed my skin so much same spot it was numb. I won't be coming back. I've had better luck at smaller places like Lucky Foot Massage w\/ Micheal for 35$ One of the best I've had!

1NJPR31R-LNvDTcY_NaPmQ,Most people go to the doctor to get better.  This is the place to go if you want to get worse. Unnecessary tests?  Yes. Do they have any real docs on staff?  Questionable. This is a docs office run by accountants who will get your insurance money and copay, but are completely incompetent otherwise.

1NJPR31R-LNvDTcY_NaPmQ,Horrible!!! I've tried a couple different doctors at MD Now and the few doctors there I've dealt with offer no help, no suggestion, act frustrated, aren't friendly, don't follow up. They do blood work and you have to call constantly just to get a response on labs or elevate the matter. Then when they do call back, they have to tell you IN-PERSON what's going on. They're not worth the trouble or frustration. Find another doctor and practice is my advice.,2015-03-01,JnS_9P4To2scne5z4ky5sg

cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g,The chicken burger was very good - the highlight of the meal. Fries were a little too rich (truffle oil and parm?). Farm burger was cooked well and the duck bacon was tasty; however, they committed a cardinal sin: overcooking the fried egg. The yoke was nearly solid when it should have been very runny. Overall an okay meal but nothing to suggest that burgers are their specialty.,2013-05-27,slvOBlJPuycV9Mn2VS17Nw

There was such a good variety of food and had things that were different than all the other breakfast places so we couldn't decide what to get so we ordered a ton of stuff and shared it all lol.

e4NQLZynhSmvwl38hC4m-A,So on this taco Tuesday trip to backyard taco, the register didnt honor taco tuesday! Nooooooo!  So I paid full price for 6 tacos. All good, I called when I got home and they made it right. I have nothing bad to say about this spot.  Now I have a reason to go back before next tuesday!  See taco Tuesday starts at 2pm and its 2:08pm when I ordered (see pic)  Not sure why it didnt honor the deal but like i said, they fixed it and were very polite about it. Great job BYT!,2017-10-10,9PY47nJL62nTb0TSUvKhfQ

Then we waited almost 40 minutes for the main course.  Every time we asked for something else like refilling our tea or a bowl of rice (which they charge extra when ordering any stew!) it took almost ten minutes.  To say the least we will never come back.,2013-05-14,c7vShA9u-mYgcjVEQYFhIQ

Now as for the quality of hair that can be purchased at the weave scene and the lady that installed my hair horrible!  They charge for every little thing.  I Ended up getting the higher package which came close to 500 dollars.  It was a rip off.  They did offer for me to come back but Not worth the headache, time or your money.,2014-01-18,Ga_R_rc-f3Bu7ZrnxtE76A

Before he cuts, i told him that i want the same style as what i had (slick back w side partition) and just to trim it. After he cut the top too short, he offered if i want a faux hawk???? Wtf. If i wanted a faux hawk i would ask for it. Not an authentic barber. Wont be coming here again.,2015-07-05,Mq7QrCtnMVzZeWHWkksmlw

I quit this spa for it's uncleanliness and lies. Also make sure you're​ purshasing a new unused product that hasn't​ been opened to make samples and put  back on the shelf.

I can leave my son at Life Time's child care while I get my beauty on - even if I go for a massage!! He has a blast and I get pampered.,2013-03-29,b0ZGXpc6drGGnV8SyTne4w

scLvLqVVIOWZbVT-exGjjg,We love the good and casual atmosphere. A bit pricey but yummy food. Here's a tip though:  every time I dine alone with my young daughter, several times, when we go to the ladies room, they clear food\/drink even if most is untouched. This occurs if you leave silverware in still 'eating position"" make eye contact etc. really annoying esp if you've had only a few bites and who wants to see a $9 glass if wine go to  Always the same wait\/bus girl thar does, it's a little creepy.,2014-04-10,wZRDf5hNiRkGA9j8en9z2g

k3X6J0IE6xWMSBjrBG2ZGA,Food is good as is typical of all locations. However on approximately 6-8 occasions, we have not received 1 or more items that we've ordered. The staff is usually distracted and disengaged. Orders take an unusually long time to prepare.

gS4ZzhSjdEEFj-lLUbIxWg,Super disappointed! Walked in there looking to buy a new flavor. The nice taller man with a Mohawk up sold us into two new flavors, a new battery, & a tank. He was AWESOME! He ten explained it would be more beneficial to me to just get a new starter kit as it comes with 1 free flavor included and would save me just a little bit of money. Who's not down to save just a bit of money these days? So my husband and I picked my new pink battery, pink tank, a flavor.,2013-07-21,cvAOBUm7f8cNgOMvl2JZfQ
gS4ZzhSjdEEFj-lLUbIxWg,Continued. I tried just about every flavor and every flavor I liked they didn't have in stock for the right nicotine mg. I FINALLY found a flavor (space jamz flav) that was the right level and some guy from nowhere came out to tell us he wouldn't include that in the package & when I told them they didn't have my nicotine level in anything he said ""oh well."" We walked out and will never go back there again! No customer service at all.,2013-07-21,cvAOBUm7f8cNgOMvl2JZfQ

This changes the taste dramatically The exception dressing is too thick to adequately mix in at the table.     I did appreciate the discussion I had with the Manager about this.

It's not thick and creamy like I've always had. I don't mind that it's not sweet; because that's what the agave is for. But it was like they blended 1 acai smoothie pack with a bucket of ice.

_KVi6kbqS_m-PayhRei8UQ,Also not a fan of Charter. There is no supervisor locally or nationally who can resolve concerns. I put my service on hold while I was away some months, and without contacting me they cut the cables to my home. It cost me about $80 to reconnect. Then they didn't tell me that a new account number was assigned. My payment was posted to the ""old"" account, and for weeks I have been trying to get them to move the payment to the new account, as I am getting calls that my service will be disconnected!,2017-07-19,Sk2j5AFDfMozLHiW4lJxqA

Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA,They run out of items ALL THE TIME. Especially the gluten free buns. You have to wait forever to order to find this out. I once had them do the burger on lettuce since they didn't have the buns and it was such an awful mess. They've had supply issues for a long time. I'm not sure why they haven't figured it out yet. If you need gluten free I would call ahead to see if they have it.,2016-01-24,CfvrvluqUvazSOyN2x0tiA

Also, the server is so rude, she tried to keep the change as tip ($15 bill, paid $20). When asked for change, she stomped back to the cash, then came back and slammed it on the table.

L2p0vO3fsS2LC6hhQo3CzA,I love gourmet burgers, and I also LOVE In N Out burgers.

L2p0vO3fsS2LC6hhQo3CzA,Matt's has okay food, I don't know why it is so packed, the quality of food has gone down since it started. The guy serving me was a skinny dude and he forgot about our table. I had to ask 3 times for a refill and they seemed upset about me asking. I noticed that the bussers don't wash their rags after cleaning a table. They were also out of toilet paper. My also had to ask for a different fork because mine was dirty. All I want to say is that it has horrible service and it is over price!!!!,2013-07-22,df_czRWDaygdp2a7D2X4fA

I had the corned beef hash, which was mediocre at best, however my wife did enjoy her omelette. Save yourself the heartache and just go to an IHOP or Denny's, the food will be better and most likely will the service. I sincerely wanted this to be my new b-fast spot. It just doesn't cut the mustard. If the food appeared as pictured it might be a different story.,2013-06-16,Xj3RFGgzu0PW9P3CXs-rqg

Not really a gated community since its open during business hours (any joe can just come in, unwanted friends or enemies). Gated community's are closed at all times.

There's two entrances but only one hostess stand and no room to stand there waiting without hovering over nearby tables. Went with a group of 8 for one visit and they held a large table for a group who wasn't  there, even though they don't take reservations. So we stood next to an empty table for 20 minutes...very annoying. But brunch menu is awesome!!,2016-04-17,xl8aH5Z52J4mtZzvIiiEow

OZC42gnhlJ_auXduDRfMoQ,Service is bad & slow. It took 10 minutes after sitting to get our drink orders taken (only 5 tables with patrons). I sat near the open kitchen area, I observed the staff. I saw the waitress move toast on the plate with her bare hands - Wash Much?  The hash browns were good & my wife enjoyed her omelette.  Big problem with the crepes.  The crepes came from the kitchen burned on the edges.  To his credit the cook noticed me flaking off the burnt edges and offered to make us another crepe to go.,2013-05-11,ekm9VgXEk9i9qLdL_eUGaQ

OZC42gnhlJ_auXduDRfMoQ,What an unfortunate miss. With a concept and space that should be excellent, I can only give this place 2 stars. We ate there for breakfast and were the only ones there. Eggs were well cooked but the rest was not good. The ""salad"" that was 1\/3 of the plate was undressed, the ""hollandaise"" on the Benedict was solid (I mean not a sauce at all but a congealed ball of grease) and the sides if bacon for $2.50 consisted of 1 slice of bacon divided to cover the plate.

RZFryvOkznd4jtpj8PbSzg,We didn't expect to be so disappointed. There was no bartender at all during their ""happy hour"" was odd, our waitress had to make us our drinks which took her 20 minutes. Our server had absolutely no knowledge of the menu. One of our group members ordered an appetizers as his meal- they were out but we weren't informed until half way through the meal. The server would disappear and not refill drinks. I would rather do take out then sit in there again. The only good thing was the sushi itself.,2013-06-30,8sCq08d2BPMJRTOaoLE-lw

I was the first and only person in at 9am by 9:15 the secretary tells me that she has ""texted"" the doctor and is waiting to hear from him. She later calls him and informs me he's not anwering so she has no idea when he will arrive. By 9:25 she tells me he has ""texted"" her saying he is stuck in traffic and will be another 20mins or more!! Unproffesional and unreliable!,2013-10-19,sudaqA42uzAqHnHOqCbkKA

They charge you a $275.00 non refundable cleaning deposit and when we moved in several things weren't done.  One of the assistant assured us that it would all be fixed and u have been here 8 months and there is still work to be done.

9yRS-SNzkfmThx2JJoilwA,The dull white guy that took our order (happens to be the owner apparently) was undeniably rude the way he took our orders because my 3 year old son wanted his attention to order something. Next he tells us not to ring the small bell ever again (ever heard of saying pls?) and then he pretty much made two of our Chai extra light instead of extra strong! Shame how manners, ethics and hospitality is lost on some people. Must be a racist Trump supporting fan! He should learn some manners really!,2016-10-12,5jVnqW7DiDaLL9_rImuoTQ

yZIbLgULM1I-wTri8r4IjQ,I want to say that Chris is great and it's a low key bar, but I get told off or some very rude hipster patrons the odd time.  Chris will sometimes scoff at me, and while I get the stress, I'm done being a whipping boy.  Great to bring a date or friend but probably the worst to meet anyone new.  I'm not sure if I'm coming back after tonight's beyond rude interaction.  Thanks for being nice to me when you were Chris.,2017-07-05,lDEyIcD1LNCfx1fuC9k-ag

DzshamutZ350laV6Ji9xFQ,Completely different from the first location. Chairs were too high, too hard and the tables too far and too low. You couldn't move either of them. Nearby tables had not been cleaned. It was as hot inside as it was outside. 4 different menu items were not available. The server gave me a stained little cup that was obviously just washed since it was wet. Reminds me of the carenderias in Cebu. I don't mind carenderias but if I'm paying $$ for this place, I expect more. Our food took so long too.,2017-05-15,9WiEffSgWX0A1L9janBeIQ

Lukewarm water, a hack job cuticle cutting that left me with an INFECTION in my big toe, and a really poor paint job, and all within the span of 10 minutes. I went over to the nail bar to get my hands done, and they were done within 6 minutes. They didn't seal the edges, the paint coats were uneven. And my manicure chipped within 2 days.

d7ozMWbBwcFOkHM3zmktfA,My husband and i were Teharu fans until we found this place - Excited to have a sushi place closer to home! Some of the other negative reviews make this place sound scary, but after eating here we disagree - this place is awesome! Hip, clean, good food choices (that support gluten free eating!!), and cheap. They have 1$ - 3$ plates and the portion sizes are good.The only negative thing is that beer is more expensive here then at Teharu - it's 6$. Otherwise we recommend Ahi!! :),2013-09-22,eYLZXq8_CkaEFtwta2zwHg

The most unpleasant part of the evening was the owner (J Sam) absolutely WOULD NOT leave us be. First it was saying hi, then it was stories about his girlfriends, then if was talking about how he runs shirtless...My poor fiancé just kept making these faces for me to save her and alas I could not. My suggestion is to try to make it in a non egomaniacal evening.,2017-01-02,Ic5Mn6IHU46sj9WzJ2KFEg

I had ordered a sectional in November '13 it is April '14 now it was supposed to be delivered in a week from the warehouse. They told me it was there but when it came time for delivery they never had one.

u53gz-HlTfMoSSlMJlpPEg,Never really a big fan of spray tans but my friend recommended Dina when I complimented her tan. I'm a total believer now. I got non stop compliments and her coming to my house to spray was the best thing ever! She's a total perfectionist and won't leave until your tan looks perfect (and that only takes her about 5 minutes!) no booth where you're suffocating and breathing in tanning spray, just super cute and trendy Dina making you look fabulous!,2013-04-26,UQBBrEz-Wm40R7a1tBVf7Q
u53gz-HlTfMoSSlMJlpPEg,I called Dina to come to my house, which is all the way in the city in shadyside, and she was more than accommodating. She showed up with her tent and product, set me up, made me feel very comfortable, and made it look so easy. I got a light tan, two layers. I was nervous because when I was spray tanned 4 years ago it was extremely streaky and got on every bra and piece of clothing. Not AT ALL the case with Brushed By Dina. I can't stop getting compliments and I'll never go in a cancer bed again,2013-05-01,s5E5DQ505eoYV2OZKfnvEA

I have had luck in getting a seat most times, as people are really kind and don't mind sharing a table (I usually sit and read, so not an imposition). A couple of times I have been in and am disappointed by some people taking up two tables between two, with their laptops - that is a reflection on those people, though, not Dineen!,2017-12-03,HFdj73VaRtbP7fxGkn3Q-g

YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,Great food and great beer. Nachos were among the best ever tasted. Perfect blend of spice and a touch of sweet. 1842 burger was amazing; caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms and truffle aioli were the perfect combo. Others had delicious fish and chips; very fresh with a light batter - literally melted in your mouth. Chef Michael Mina happened to be in the restaurant and was incredibly friendly and generous with his time. Pub 1842 is a must visit.,2013-06-28,NrRD9fpxEsCVBlfQ8PcpAg

The spa owner personally greeted us, accommodated 6 massages with less than 24 hour notice, provided tea and water and a free gift.

Go to different goodyear shop someone forgot to put a gasket on oil filter. They corrected the problem.

bhKViMFgXTxB3DK4Nrp9TQ,The absolute worst experience I have ever had with any type of home service repair person. American Home Shield sent this company out to fix our garage door.

WGmMEWmievG-DqD_Ix5KMg,I was on vacation in toronto and wanted to tried this place. I did not like this restaurant at all! Food was not good and the portion sides were very small. I'm originally from Peru and I was very disappointed. I ordered anticuchos and jalea. Anticuchos tasted ok but these were ridiculous small pieces for $10. The jalea had barely any seasoning and the picante lacked some salt. I live in florida and I'm used to eat a good portion size of food for less money. Only good thing was the pisco sour.,2014-05-11,RVAouE4Ok9biKCUAL6MgZA

I have gone several times and I love the chicken vindaloo and the chicken curry. The chicken tikka is so delicious also. The food is real Indian food the way it should be.

Only good thing was the garlic knots which came out fresh and hot.  Wish they had a little more fresh garlic on them though but still good.  Won't be back.,2013-05-31,1GaHrcycSClIVuzGxN9MCA

Jj9F27mlp00IJQuPtAePPQ,Buy their bulk ammo with caution. I purchased 250 rounds of 9mm from them a few times and they are great. However, I actually sat down and counted the ammo in the box and I was missing 43 rounds. I was told that some people open the box up and put some more ammo in their box and there really isn't anything they can do about it... I feel like taping up the box with a sticker or something would resolve this.. Anyways, aside from that great guys and store,2017-04-25,AlrKpOQYhDM_kh9QncOsjQ

3O5nZKcnly1S9wdjPYDMUw,McKenzie & James have the worst attitude.  Not management material. Neither seems to care about other people,  or animals.  90% of the animals there get sick.  A parrot named big bird that lived there,  until recently,  was always stuck in her cage and  some employees would tell her to shut up because she would yell.  Fake pet store.  There are a couple of good people there. Oh,  and don't give them your email address,  or prepare to get email EVERY DAY,  until you block them.,2016-10-02,2xQrKV-XON9BVj0HBY2YSA

3eYjYgsJxvRk7ULU9Lx4WA,This is authentic in style and more of a grocery store\/deli. If you want Americanized food and deli such as Aladdin's don't go. This is a very typical type of store in the Middle East . Have an open mind and explore the shelves and ask when items were made if not noted ie. bread delivery date. They will always say it's fresh so ask for a date.  Pre packaged foods are good and not Americanized so if they taste different it isn't because they are bad, it's because they are made right!,2017-10-07,M3Xml3p9zcqA6asZ9lJYOQ

uHUcYpGlcdlu5m7oiZGY6w,Serving portions are small, so you can somewhat say it's overpriced. They didn't have sisig when we went, and it was within the first two weeks of opening. Our food came in at different times which is unacceptable in my opinion. Our server was ok. Based on my observation, it doesn't look like they were trained. They are actually more concerned about cleaning up the tables rather than taking care of the actual customers. Overall, very displeased with the experience.,2013-11-07,UWBZAhN5nUQSZ7xgOU5GCw

-WlGnDiAwHdhclu9l8786g,Great rooms. Love the bathrooms that are large with double sinks, shower separate from the large soaking tub and the water closet. Views are great of mountains and lake.  Lobby  is a little small for the number of rooms and there is only one dining room. Food is decent but nothing special.  The staff is nice but there are too few of them. The village outside is cute.

We arrived Saturday afternoon, as soon as we were seated, the waiters ignored us for quiet a while and were clueless on whose section we were part of.

After reappearing, the waitress had very lousy attitude and we felt like we had to beg for service....we were offended as this place lacked any caring for customer service.

Before the server created my coffee drink, I leaned over and asked her to please not put as much ice in my drink. She said okay. How does my drink come out? Packed with ice and barely any flavor!  I reminded her that I didn't want much ice in my drink, she looked at me and told me, ""oh I am off work now I'm getting ready to leave.""  And walked away!  Wow!,2017-09-09,RwyfYmbx6YzF8oxMICor1g

KokCcoahHa2ajm-C_7bJrw,Remember it's hot at night in many parts of that region. So be prepared to sweat it out in the roof tent and if sleeping inside, you'll have to have the car running for the A\/C. Buy a bag of ice for your fridge, keeps it super cool in the 100 degree heat of AZ and NV. Get the unlimited mileage option so you can explore and not have to worry about it!

Food was mediocre, service was just ok.They charged us for hot water; 1 cup for $1 & charged for every refill after that.After we questioned the ""tap water policy"" Our waitress had the nerve to tell us most restos now charge for hot water.We asked for a couple of plates for cupcakes that we brought in to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and they charged us $3\/person for plating fees.So needless to say, my friends & I will NOT be recommending this place to anyone.,2013-10-26,QDnthgu0ln6wEqIrbD08ZQ

It's in the plaza where 168 supermarket is. We're having the pan fried noodles with XO sauce, Wonton Noodles, Spicy steak cubes with rice cakes and ramen, and the Hammered Chicken with rice. Unfortunately,  mangoes are not in season so we could not try the mango crepe. Instead we will try the Durian crepe! The owner of the place is pleasant!,2014-12-22,HqYNqqTjculllCkyXo6TGw

The decor was bright w\/artistic photographs of Route 66.  Menu has a nice variety of American dishes along with ""daily specials"".  The server, Cheyenne, was very congenial & provided us with samples of  homemade Jambalaya & chili.  I went with the Jambalya (daily special) & my husband had the meat loaf.  We will definitely return for a light casual reasonably priced meal.,2014-04-03,-sQEEUkAXwou6PxTg5zRTA

lpfuJoqC_kGZcvk4diZkHw,Was in town for leasure and needed a quick touch up on my sides and back. I enjoy barbershops and this was a close one in the area. Although the guys are talented at what they do my experience was a little disheartening. I went in for a ""line up"" from what I understood was a clipper trim up that was listed for $12 on there website. At the end the total was $30.    Shocker. So just a heads up, it's cash only and no services or prices listed. Know what your getting into.,2016-12-13,l5_RgcWDVteIgrlWla8txw

_wzeJKSvt6_sas3BPUHBjw,I feel like this mcdonalds only hires retarded people. Honestly, whenever i go there they are slower than death. And when i get what i ordered 50% of the time is old . Unless u specify that u want everything to be made fresh, you will get food from the garbage cause thats how it tastes like. And dont even try to go there in the morning. U will be late at work or miss the bus. They seriously need more and better staff.,2015-04-30,gbT6bocSoq6yB-5cs_v_Bg

1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,Best time to go is lunch. Worst time is the last hour and a half before they close.  Our family has gotten burned several times with rock  hard rice, brown lettuce and extremely salty pork (like they were trying to mask something). We're always enjoyed the afternoon service. They even let us order a few minutes before they opened. Extremely nice of them!  Oh, and the food was as delicious as we are used to.  Nothing has stopped us from going,  we're just mindful of the time of day.,2014-07-19,SmuqmcoBmy2sYJmQF5yCZw

They probably braid very well but as for weaves, don't let them tell you they can do your weave or that it will look nice because the fact is they truly can't weave worth a damn! They have the nerve to call what they do a ""technique"". They will try to send you out of the shop looking like you let a blind 3 year old sew perfectly good hair in with yarn.

My wife and I had chicken sandwiches. I had the fuel inferno and the wife the fuel griller. Both were tasteless. The appetizer was   Stuffed peppers and that was pretty good.

zip-V5uRmSI5965zerOvdg,Hey everyone,  it's Kevin with ASAP BEE REMOVAL.  Check your home twice a month from March to October. Look at your eaves and your foundations.  If you see bees coming and going from one particular place, you need to give us a call. Better to catch them early to avoid costly hive removal fees. Bee safe and be blessed.

t6FCO31z5uYrCM26jCaIaA,My 2nd poor experience. Our server was inattentive. Our wine was never decanted and we ended having to get up and pour our own. 1 person in our party ordered a steak and it came out at least 15 min after the rest of our party's meals. When it  was brought out it was way over done. They said sorry & offered to buy us drinks but by that time our meals were done. It was a very disappointing experience & after this I will not return and will be sure to not recommend this restaurant in the future.,2017-02-23,vubmtzml_ozOpCQqmrE9VQ

Apparently (according to the employee) everything is made in China! They take measurements (badly, at that), have the suits, shirts etc., made cheaply in China, then sell them to you AS IF they're tailor made.  They use industry standards - crazy! Go to any retail store and pay half the price.,2015-08-23,a17czh62Cwi9Pw53AE53Mw

33iX6gCZtbvXT2wLIUOQRg,I've gone here 3 times including today's visit and although they have great prices and massages I felt pressured to leave a higher tip. I usually leave between $5-$10 and they acted like it wasn't enough when they asked if I'm leaving a tip and I said how much the owner I think spoke to the guy who massaged me and they're both Asian so I didn't know what they said but I got the impression as if they didn't appreciate the tip and just wanted more. I like the prices but they shouldn't pressure,2014-04-27,CMlON8TpOb4xqSC1-4PQwA
GPpqPGNvQFKGcYetAux5zQ,Just spent 6 hours tonight in their ER and I'm beyond livid. First of all, I'm 19 weeks pregnant and left work because i had trouble breathing and have a history of miscarriage & potiential asthma. the process at first seemed good but after a couple hours it got far worse. I waited forever to have a Doppler done on my legs and then the nurse was very rude and one of the other doctos over heard her and agreed she was being unprofessional so for that I'm reporting her. Terrible experience.,2014-07-01,CMlON8TpOb4xqSC1-4PQwA

E-pB9yzKnA3kz1cB1zpr6g,This place is in close proximity of my house so it's nice to be able to walk over and have a beer. But this places has sub-par food that is way over priced for the quality & what you get. The bartenders are a bit preoccupied with their friends or regulars that the rest of us have to wait up to 40 minutes for another drink. The management and\/or owner really needs to evaluate their staff and food if they want to stay in business! Hate to see it go but it will things don't change.,2014-06-14,sfzrYlxwBsQnM_ienmmEzQ

4DtjA7EoxUSyWiXEuElPVA,This is a great gym, especially if your new to fitness or coming off a long layoff. Yes the weights don't go as heavy as more standard gyms which would be my only gripe; However, thats a smarter way to train if you're just starting out or making a comeback. Slow progress is the best progress when it comes to fitness. It allows your body time to adjust to training. And with a calmer and less intense atmosphere that helps you to focus on simply improving.,2016-07-11,00KBvm45X3IJosDyEgsVDA

NOtdhHE4oTaODsJgW8GXPA,I have been shopping here for several years because you could usually find a designer item in excellent condition for a reasonable price. But the last few years I have noticed  that the quality is no longer there. Their clothing is old, worn out, dirty, torn and buttons or zippers broken. I guess buyer beware when you shop there. Also, many items are not designer anymore....you will even see clothing from Costco, H&M, Target, etc. I would rather buy new for the non-designer items.,2015-12-19,iN0u63tMoLI71VT5sTeJUA
NOtdhHE4oTaODsJgW8GXPA,Terrible customer service. Lots of clothing in poor condition. Also noticed them carrying brands like forever 21 which is not something their customers are looking for. I was going to buy a free people top until I noticed three stains plus pulling in the chiffon. Granted these were fairly minimal and normally I would have bought the top regardless. However due to their complete lack of customer service I decided to pass. I have previous experience consigning which they are also terrible at.,2015-02-16,FT9mWIXyAL4SY2T5x2YrmQ
KTjJjYNVj7z-BUOiz_5hlw,Great coffee, not so great service. Allow at least 10 minutes for an espresso drink. Often there's only one person on duty- even at 8-9 am, so if someone orders an omelet, everything shits down for 10 min    while they go back to cook it.,2014-05-05,KFsNJ0jPmFlU262IKGNlTg

1TGti2jN5PstqlHelBBfNw,The menu is almost completely devoid of non-beef options the only options are a veggie sandwich and grilled cheese. You have to buy fries separate from your sandwich, which in this instance were very salty. The food is served in a brown bag, sandwich at the bottom and french fries right on top of it. The sandwich is ok at best, same with the service. If you are looking for a broader menu this is not the place to come to.,2013-10-06,lmShRf2EbKUBdaM6asY6hg

ybqRkz5KfW5dOSGEDX6a-g,Don't waste your time enrolling in Somerset (north Las Vegas) Aliante either. My children attend there and it's horrible ! The teachers don't return assignments or test. How are you supposed to know how your child is progressing in school??? Some middle school teacher don't even teach, they just assign a packet at the being of the semester. Somerset no longer issues report cards. All grades a given though the infinite campus website, which is a JOKE! The website is almost never up to date....,2015-01-08,nHjk08LHmIpMPrsjJj4Z7w
ybqRkz5KfW5dOSGEDX6a-g,..The students are allowed to bully each other, and several teachers(middle school) engage in a lot of inappropriate classroom discussions(sexual, racial lots of racial comments). It's really sad this school has declined severely. I wouldn't recommend this school to any parent that values their child's education or safety. It's pretty obvious the principal didn't do her job when it comes to screening teachers.,2015-01-08,nHjk08LHmIpMPrsjJj4Z7w

b_pDMGf6wukNcuLvCK86IQ,Sold to them today, but won't do it again.  The staff was friendly, but they are more than doubling their mark up from what they offer you.  It was disappointing to say the least.  I understand they need to make money, pay for their space, their employees, etc. so all I can come up with is their rent is crazy expensive.

FSse3XPk9WPxa3ILayUHyw,So glad I went with Saba!!! After a NIGHTMARE scenario the day of my wedding on 12\/10\/2016, I had to fire Mirage Limousines due to fraudulent acts of changing all the terms of what we agreed to (including the time they would pick me up from our wedding reception, the type of car, and the cost). I called Saba Limo just an hour before the ceremony began in desperation to get a ride scheduled for later that evening for my wife and I to our hotel. They came through in the clutch!!!

dNr7VKRti8dXWE-jzfVBtQ,Ok, here's the skinny: completely hit or miss for us so far. I have eaten here a total of 3 times now and i think I've kind of figured them out: they are nice, well-meaning people, but can't be consistent. The first time I ate here, the food was really good and the service fine and good. The other two times, not so much. The atmosphere you cannot argue with, but they need to get the kitchen in order and the wait staff, while very friendly, needs to be more efficient, period.,2016-04-17,h0DLKYdpbcHRVZx2BFW42g

0EcCWB9_VxTOoAh_1Wr_RQ,Went for the 1st time and the service was very slow. Crabcake appetizer came out late because they burnt it. On top of that my father's burger was extremely overcooked and tasted extremely salty. The fries were also re-cooked. We had two glasses of wine and a beer and the total of all three drinks was $29. A little pricey for a sports bar in Pittsburgh if you ask me. Also the communication between the manager and the servers was poor. Nice atmosphere but overpriced and average food.,2014-04-07,Kv_uoXtTgUDf4eewg-kmIw

sSWy-yEYPCHLss0LvmAhhA,One tip is that the waitstaff seem to get busy and disappear for long periods of time in the kitchen. It can take some time for the server to recognize that you're finished eating and bring you the bill. If you're in a rush it can be a waste of time to wait to flag them down. I don't bother waiting for the bill and I just walk to the cash register at the front when I'm done. They usually spot me from the kitchen and I'm paid up very quickly.,2013-11-14,vN5zGsljpV_LmBEAfhjDvA

Upon trying to switch rooms, I learned the hotel is a sell out, so they quickly offered an ionizer for the room while I was out.    It's in the bedding, the leather headboard, the pillows.   I've never experienced such an overpowering stench of stale cigarettes.  The toilet is filthy, as well.  Not a place I will return to.,2016-06-08,dbF0U9ii5k3M0moxEt1nOg

8796vXaydw2aY_zER0n9uA,Even though it's outdoor seating thy aren't pet friendly. My guy got to stay because he is a service dog for my PTSD but before asking if he's a service dog they just told us to leave which is against the law according to the American disabilities act. They should first ask if he is a service dog and if I say yes thy can only ask what service he provides instead of kicking us out. Kind of rude and against the law. Made me feel embarrassed.,2014-05-18,q8pYnjIwWbgIK_H0A2Txbw

8796vXaydw2aY_zER0n9uA,Entrances at this location are strange, and aren't labeled. One door opens between two full tables of people deep into the restaurant. The second door opens directly in front of the kitchen. Unsure how the seating here works as it's been different every time I've been here. Sometimes open seating other times you are seated. I'd suggest waiting by whichever of the doors, or just wandering around inside.,2015-12-16,8mrx9X_qEiLXv59Mrw2oQw

foQZ6guS0l49trURKh7vlA,This may have been the worst food I have had in over 10 years. It was horribly bland.  We mentioned that our drinks tasted ""off"" many times before the bartender realized the soda was not operating properly, no compensation or corrective actions were made.  Our busser was one of the most delightful people I've ever encountered, but our server never once smiled, tho she was pleasant. The selection of bourbons was quite limited, which seemed strange for a place called ""Double Barrel"".  Never again,2014-04-21,k8Hm1TK7zF5G9AiuSIlcCg

But overall, if you want to explore something outside of Vegas, come here :) don't forget to check out the visitor center first because the scenic tour exits you completely out of the area.,2013-08-02,bVA6dAMy-bc9KTFbEOCSyQ
