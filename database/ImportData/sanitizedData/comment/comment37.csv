zDKH2ua2DauqiWOAP9yz7g,For the amount of money paid, increase the portion size. It doesn't have to be a huge increase but for $10 I expected a little more slaw and a thicker burger,2015-05-06,EgA6sMKj6xobNMoPrbiJOQ,

aisuiJvni7FNMezu5seAHw,Our air went out late one night so I called Mark after his company was recommended to me by a co-worker.  Mark had his tech, Luke, out 4 hours after the call.  Luke was awesome and diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes.  The repair was done quickly and the price was very fair.  Not once did Luke or Mark try to sell me anything extra.  Both guys were very down to earth and knowledgable. I will definitely call Everest for any further repairs.,2017-06-16,iFCXAFaEfPIhJc9CjQfHBQ,

lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw,Horrible place to visit. We ordered 3 w\/ 1 being the mushroom & vegetable sizzler w\/ Schezuan sauce. The mushroom & vegetable sizzler came w\/ no mushrooms. When we told the server, she just got us some mushrooms on the side & said here you go. The owner didn't even apologize. He was convincing us dat we didn't miss out on anything. Y should I pay $20 for something which is not even half of what I ordered? Also too much sauce on the food making it difficult to taste anything else. Waste of money.,2015-12-28,WSfooHvv7T2LzhdazOucLw,

Di5QdSiP0Kd20abQvRSiTw,War heute schon wieder im Grünen Michel ....immer wieder ein Genuss . Ich konnte draußen sitzen , bekam ein tolles Mittagsessen und eine spritzige Soda Holunder - serviert vom Chef persönlich . Auch die Bedienung am Mittag mit ihrem offenen freundlichen und zugewandten Gesicht war angenehm - ich liebe dieses Restaurant !,2016-08-19,mHqroxeDrncDqZGBA74WHw,
Di5QdSiP0Kd20abQvRSiTw,Ja , so ist es , Mut und Qualität wird belohnt . Nun habe ich auch den oberen  Raum im Michel kennen gelernt , sehr geeignet für kleine und mittlere Veranstaltungen . Und er ist ebenso liebevoll dekoriert und eingerichtet , wie unten ,hier ist bedeutend mehr Platz für Tische und Menschen . Ich bin wieder am köstlichen Jim Knopf Burger hängen geblieben ( er könnte einen Tick wärmer sein ) mit den super - leckeren Süßkartoffel Frites und einem Salat Schüsselchen . Schmeckt nach mehr !! Bis bald !,2016-08-11,mHqroxeDrncDqZGBA74WHw,

Rg8PqyyoJmTaYx-OHpxFfg,Be aware of the opening hours of the clinic and the actual time doctors show up to the clinic. I came here on a Saturday because the website says it is open at 9am. I was the first one and 50 minutes later I am still waiting for the doctor to show up so I can be seen. Waiting to be seen because of volume is one thing but waiting for the doctors to show up at the advertised hours of business is another.,2015-07-04,V_itycuUjtCzwwFB2aX3hA,

Vbal-AZnu2w6NttIKfdjDg,We returned to what is now my favorite coffee shop in Las Vegas. Joseph described for us a new concoction he created called the Walter White (you have to have seen Breaking Bad to appreciate the namesake). If yo want the perfect espresso drink to get you going or keep you going, give this deliciously invigorating drink a try. Espresso with a touch of Carmel and a hint of chocolate rounded off with a little cream, this drink is divine.  For other adventures, check out this little gem of a cafe.,2015-11-28,e4uyqSXaYcjq8bCUowMFkA,

TaEASKZil0TT7CAzyqFUgw,Awesome atmosphere, good drinks, but the food is mediocre at best. The wait was long (probably because it's still new). The service was slow. They quoted us 1.5 hours on a Thursday evening. When we got seated, it took more than 15 mins for our server to get to us.  For what it is, it's incredibly overpriced. I'd much rather get good quality food from a local business, but it'd be a cool place to go for a night out - their drinks are pretty strong.,2017-07-13,og-vD9plC5tinlV74Ohndg,

I felt like a ""number"" and felt the crew could take lessons from the employees at Frost in Gilbert. The ice cream is delish though as the fam loved the Island Fudge (with Coconut on top), Mint Chocolate Chip and Moose Tracks.

0odAupWjDV8gwhaLqyh1-A,IMPORTANT! this place closes at 9pm- not 10pm as posted here. We had a terrible experience here- we went out of our way to go to THIS location because they were ""open"" until 10. Instead we received terrible service and were turned away at 9pm!! Note- people were still inside eating and there was still food on the line. They have a terrible rating anyway which we sadly failed to check out before- I wish we had check because it would have saved us quite the hassle.,2016-07-16,D2DQvXzLFTi-MJBtvgx0tA,

N_2yEZ41g9zDW_gWArFiHw,The ice cream is NOT GOOD. It melts so fast, while you are eating it you are creating a mess! You need a lot of tissue and one cup when you eat the ice cream. Ok, I get they're business idea of making an unique ice cream, but they are trying too hard.The ice cream just full of sugar and cream. When you are eating your hands are sticky, it's so easy to drip on your shirt, and you just don't feel good.  just because it's all over Instagram and Twitter, doesn't mean it's good.,2015-09-22,sgLcwunZZNZgdprC9FJwKA,

68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,Flock & Fowl has been serving the hungry chicken masses for near two years out of a humble 8 table restaurant. Recently featured in USA Today, Food & Wine Magazine, and the Las Vegas RJ, the restaurant can be quite busy mid-shift, so arriving closer to opening or after 2PM will yield a much higher success for parties larger than 4 getting sat and fed quickly. Typically, all ordering happens at register with the entire party arrived and ready to be fed. New larger location expected by year's end.,2017-07-07,b3cssGUI0x0w12L7yM1yLw,

Ch_iMphfKLaWbBdzbtc3Ow,Let's start by I needed a bigger vehicle for my family of 5. So I went to Car Guru.com they sent to this Johnny legends. They had a suburban and that was the type I was looking for. So I went there to see if I can get it or not so they got all of the information from me and my wife. Then the next day they wanted me and my wife to come down. So after work we went their just to find out that we was not approved to get the vehicle.  I will recommend this place to get a vehicle.,2017-08-04,w_ncKCr935xzTD9EkF_2gg,

bqDFZDfDPdCut0CbybDUrA,Don't order the Piccata. It is not piccata in any sense of the word. Also, don't come here if u are a woman dining alone or ""look"" like you won't be a big tipper. They will ignore you and not provide the same service as large groups. They will also seat you in the bar instead of the actual restaurant. This is not only annoying, it's uncomfortable and made me feel like an outcast. Jokes on them, I usually tip 40-60% because I own a restaurant and know how hard the front of the house works.,2016-10-11,q9jZUebCdCEOXYPsuTdVJQ,

gHMkTOvq89eNuVxnpF444w,I would give the Q a solid 3 of 5 stars. I had the wings and mac and cheese and a side of deviled eggs. The wings themselves were pretty good but the jerk sauce is definitely some crappy store bought concoction. The wings were a better than average size. The mac and cheese well lets just say its not. A greesy oily clump of noodles with burnt fried cheese on top. Yeah its that bad. The deviled eggs are definitely not your grandma's eggs but hey at least the plate presentation was on point.,2016-03-02,7gr43o1AijunYd5h1gKrmQ,

Usually too loud to carry on a conversation so not good for a first date unless you both love music. Only tried some of the food but everything I remember was delicious. 'Popcorn shrimp' is actually popcorn with shrimp in it - cute. Hesitant to give a positive review because I love how I always get a seat...

They are telling me someone must be out moving cars, but I'm here, can see my car, small lot, nobody here. Very hot outside...,2017-07-05,L2cMN8NJK1lniI3sBKEmeA,

LOOgah4nTChVUfhOxKfmaQ,We were excited about Foxy given its critical acclaim, but we were disappointed. The food was fine, but nothing to write home about. Our cocktails were good, but not very creative. Neither was the menu. The service was... VERY attentive. Maybe awkwardly attentive. All said, I would say that Foxy is an OK, high-end neighborhood spot, except it is OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced. Much better eats in the city for the price point.,2017-07-03,o3tcqVPfaOVMpoZ_9v0V2Q,

The Belt Buckle (Brisket atop waffle fries with drippings and Bama sauce) and God sauce are my absolute favorites.

She doesn't realize that when you work for someone that pays you, you have to respect them or you get fired from where you work.  So that's why I love coming here at Today Nails because they get the best employees to work for them.

ORp9PRTDtalvEGL19Wco-Q,Great sandwiches, good value.  Quiet little spot,2016-12-21,2G2O90GuoXlR7hlWZhxcWw,
ORp9PRTDtalvEGL19Wco-Q,M&J Eastside Deli has great pastrami sandwiches and their burgers are fantastic. Everything is made in-house. The pastrami is cured on site. The burger meat is ground when an order is placed and is cooked to perfection. The fries are cut from whole potatoes and even the bread and buns are homemade. Check the hours though as they sometimes change. Seating is also sometimes limited. In spite of that, M&J gets 5 Stars from me. Try the pastrami.  You'll love it.,2017-01-28,67rF7Sq_ooUirc6kcFW6MQ,

No one approaches or welcomes you to take your order so it is very easy to get lost in the shuffle. They won't think twice about casting you to the side and losing your business.

She took time to listen to all my plans and concerns and she helped me plan the move. Then my movers showed up on time, were very polite and professional, and were very fast in everything they did.

However, this is probably one of the best pollos a la braza I have tried here in Vegas. You guys need to ask your server for some ají and mayonesa for your pollo a la braza and don't forget to save room for some yummy picarones as dessert. Enjoy!,2017-11-09,sC_FX_znspR9dAft3vb6Jg,

JI43hSF4G-MIAp1pq0G0GA,I got my nails done here once for pride but they didn't do a good job. They're fairly clean but they didn't give me what I asked for. They cut too short and took too long. Also if you are into gel nails and all, their prices are too expensive and for a new place they are very inflexible. They will charge you to remove nails even if done there and they charge extra for shellac on gel nails. You can find a way better deal in Toronto!,2016-08-15,Fk0_5p_SLwcT9-PDvZ0ecg,

They actually like what they are doing in helping everyone and they don't act like it is ""just a job"". David, the owner, is probably the nicest owner you would ever meet. He offered to vacuum my car anytime I didn't feel like doing it. Come on!!! This is service, y'all.

It is precious to me and I was upset. I had reviewed Bakersfield for being so awesome and was thanked by the GM, Jeff. I took a chance and inquired about the ring and he said he would look. Well folks Jeff found my ring and is mailing it to me. I always say the best businesses are made up of the best people... And Jeff just proved it. Thanks Jeff!!,2016-05-08,jhJB0CXKalqXUyCDbhchHw,

CAy7twD5McMiNrkFWOUn7g,ro-tip:  Ecuadorean sorbetto is the same as Italian, but Ecuadorean gelato is dairy-free.  The gelatos were  just as rich and creamy as gelatos I've had with dairy, so you wouldn't know it had no fat and very few calories unless they told you.,2017-07-14,gt-m4PiUfTPGjIgB9UhjQQ,

d0aLkD3VQ3sijckod-oSDg,Yikes! the food quality and service at this joint was awful! The interior and exterior of the place looks amazing and fresh, honestly a job well done, love the all woodwork. That being said I felt like I have had better at Taco Bell. No joke. The meat was dry as a Steel Cactus would be if you tried to eat it, sauces tasted like they were out of a jar, cheese tasted moldy. One of the guest at our table said his taco tasted like it was dipped in perfume.. How do you mess up tacos,2017-06-06,w3BzTukHK9EIoE7NzwiMIA,

OJ8FKDGWI5jo0MwUv496AQ,Least professional chipotle I've ever seen. The wait averages about 30 minutes.  I think this is because the employees are dancing, singing, and really having a great time goofing off in full view of all of the patiently waiting customers.  If there are 5 people behind the counter, typically 2-3 are dancing and chatting it up, leaving 2-3 employees to handle the long lines alone.  Every time.  Chipotle corporate: send this store a REAL manager and make this location as nice as the others!,2015-12-30,Bt4S1InjsF7HsdfHoJ9iWA,

The thing that makes it work is the high ceiling and good ventilation.

CvonRhKDJaH155xhtpz_iw,I ordered Mac and cheese. It came before my friends food, so it was either eat alone or wait for everyone to get served. I shouldn't have worried, because it was inedible. The worst. Also, our table was right between the bar and wait station with the traffic pattern right next to it. Felt very noisy and like we were in the middle of a train station.  They were out of several beers on the menu. My husband loves this place, but I'd rather not return. They did comp me for the M&C.,2017-05-10,gRSTIXOtF-9SO7YaNigDFw,

We also love their sweet potato fries and chunky chips, I had melted cheese on them on Saturday night (I'm bad, I know). I also love to support non-chain businesses and like the fact that these guys are doing what they love and are good at it. Can't recommend them enough. Burger joints are plentiful in a city but not all burgers are created equal.,2017-08-07,DyiMBquc2BG8I3PUmQ5t4w,

ATqK7-ECiTFtqsh2Dj2Tjg,I'm a dancer here, and a few dancers and i apologize for your bad experience. Some of the dancers there are bad so i understand why they leave upset. Also, when it comes to stage, dancers that don't have a license, can't take any clothing off, and new girls don't know what to do. If you ever go back ask for jewels, Julie, autumn, Mary Jane, or Dakota. I've seen them dance, they take clothes off, very nice, and they don't ""rip you off"".

zc0sUY7iWuJB93AHWKy_xw,The one in Columbus is awesome! So we were excited that they were opening one here! Quality was great at first, but has gone downhill.  Food isn't quite as tasty and much to my disappointment, they changed their fries.  They used to be thin and crispy and were a must have every time I ate there. Now they are thicker and mushy.  They are fine but nothing amazing about them.  They also changed their point system, causing us to lose 300+ points.  They never followed up after we complained.,2017-12-02,z-13FoXWp5CB_fxHTHuNrw,

Food quality and service can fluctuate wildly depending on time of day, but if you sit at the bar, order drinks and maybe an app while watching a game, you'll have fun. The patio is nice, but realize that they are usually blasting commercial country songs through the outdoor, sometimes making conversation difficult. But if that's your jam, then this patio is a rather pleasant place to have a few beers.,2017-08-26,D3ubzB6RdOiMwJ6JFIL2Zw,

Kim was the first one here she is very sweet and helped me find a match for gel and regular polish for my toes which can be so difficult if it's not ""perfect match"". Most importantly she did an amazing job on my nails I will definitely come back and send a few friends over! Thanks Kim,2016-10-05,LJ5LVla3coDMhY9iYm9VNA,

When I said it was my first time in and I wanted more information, I was passed off to another girl who said I need to sign up for emails. This place is supposed to offer meal plans, but as far as I was told nothing is dealt with at the actual store, all ordering and meals are made at and shipped from corporate. If I'm looking to spend  $100+ a week, I expect a courteous, knowledgeable staff.,2017-06-23,INtZQ0e0RgeIg5vZKPWiVQ,

-Ggr1M22MxTbP2J8L7oHqw,(*positive @bottom) Dont order anything latenight as their delivery guy (2 times in a row) had so little English that we ended up not getting our order(between $20-40+I tip well) he couldn't communicate over the phone (when he ACTUALLY called)to deliver the pizza to a simple house address. Do walk-in or take your gamble.      *Honestly, OTHERWISE, they have decent pizza. Try their Canadian bacon. Also: cinnamon dessert is AMAZING, cheese &bacon bread is great if you get extra pizza sauce.,2017-01-22,-qZuhM_sz4opDCWkG6LNEA,
Xrx33FtlglUKgjR3S8Qehg,Not a full halal selection, they have 6 items to choose from which are extremely overpriced. $4.99\/lb for beef round???? This is typically $2-$3\/lb at any grocery store. Plus we always have to wait for a butcher for at least 5 minutes. They are always out of packaged halal meats, I guess we need to shop at the beginning of the week? The butcher insisted we try their kalamata olives, which were horribly brined and too salty. Just awful.,2017-07-30,6rmGr9xl_mOPSO8pxn-m8w,

GRWIABHedj1m8DDoAuTIMg,This place is a RIPOFF that's all I can say. DONT GO HERE REGARDLESS IF YOU HAVE A BUZZ OR NOT THEY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU!!! They will charge you for the preliminary $20 short lap dance even if they don't do nothing for you or not. There's no such thing as charge you $20 first then all the way for $100 later on. This is a place if you want to waste your money.,2016-10-10,P15wklW4dVsfh5S_nYj3oA,

We stopped in the other day for meat for stew, Roni helped out and we left with the fixings for beef bourguigon. I left with pork belly for flavor, beef meat, and an absolutely killer marrow broth. We have never been disappointed. The beef bourguigon was awesome.  Make sure to stop by The Meat Market and don't forget to stop by Brix wine shop next door.,2017-01-21,e8OGL09MhFvi2-pf_WAyhg,

Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this Maggiano's in downtown Summerlin. We have been there twice and unfortunately twice we've been disappointed. I have ordered two dishes that were supposed to be served with a spicy tomato sauce. Both times I got a pink sauce not read and neither time was it spicy.

Learn when to stop serving people..  quit taking advantage of drunk people..  and when those same people come back to you to tell you how they feel they were taken advantage of.. try to repair the situation... instead of giving attitude and treating the person even worse.

He did absolutely nothing to fix the problem, took my $75 check and left.  I called AHS back and was told that the owner of Husky denied ever coming to my home and said that I had cancelled the service call.

It's made of cheap plastic and broke in the same spot twice, I had to BUY a new bumper and then that one broke. It's such a problem that they actually sell replacement bumpers, they don't replace them you have to buy a new one for $6 every time it breaks. Until they can come up with a redesign bumper STAY AWAY, not worth the money.,2017-03-23,iGZ6vxCbbceMc16Y9Z4rGw,

xaFzCJe82C4N7t4zeCo3hA,My wife and I went on a weekday night. We arrived at 430. The hostess asked if we had a ""reservation"". We did not. She then informed us that the entire restaurant was booked with reservations. She also never asked if we wanted to sit in the bar, so we assumed there was nothing there as well. We then left and went to the adjoining art gallery for about a half hour. We were curious, so we checked back into the restaurant at 5. No extra customers were seated in the restaurant. We were not happy...,2017-05-18,lyAzWKLVeYFJuKXc006pVQ,

mVomtOMgBxbGvdPSaF2HjQ,Very disappointing visit to their new location.  We had gone several times to their original location and the cookies were delicious.  We decided to try their new location on Friday because we read that they would be serving coffee to go along with their cookies.  Needless to say, that wasn't the case.  No coffee.  No working bathroom.  My all-time favorite cookie, chocolate chip, was small, overpriced at $1.99, and tasted like it came from a bag of Chips Ahoy, which probably would taste better.,2017-04-15,Itwv3ycYgVk8LF4uW-W6cg,

The plate comes with chopped up iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and didn't include the usual tabule, pickled turnip, pickles, onions and no garlic sauce. I don't know if the white sauce was watered down hummus or tahini. One thing that lived up to the name was the hot sauce, it is hot!,2017-05-08,SI1IdtXtMz5eAW5oSvsj3Q,

5aeOewSy4RiI8sLLWpeNGA,Eat it the same day if you can! It is a lot tastier to eat it fresh than chilled. It also tastes a lot more like an egg tart and less like a cheese tart if it is chilled. Shared some with a friend the moment we bought it (we were both wow-ed) and saved some for a friend that couldn't make it (not so impressed the next day). Definitely different experiences.,2017-08-23,IOcVotPBIe-ZLAFZBMUccA,

The waitress and manager seem to not know the promotion. He had to call the owner, Frank, which he didn't honor the deal. Instead, he offered me 20% off I was like that's not the same as the promotion. Their food is way over priced. They say they sell sushi but it's not on the menu.

KaUB34enSO-stij40-n9dQ,Girlfriends and I decided to try this place out. 1st- server tried her best just lack of experience and no other person offered to help her. 2nd- Food took way to long. One plate at a time 3rd- Food was nothing to talk about. No shrimp. No pulled pork. Fried mushrooms cost me 9.00!! 4th- No Ac. It was hot! I can say the poor server tried her best but overall.hot mess!! And the hot sauce bottle had so much crust around the top we refused to use it.I hope they learn fast before they are shut down.,2017-11-11,XGeRa1YOiM1yCmjT2SJZkw,

FHV_6wEvwXOFQOxxoE9A_w,My husband ordered a cheeseburger. I got a burrito from the Mexican place down the way. I received and finished my burrito before his burger was ready. It was a meat patty on a bun. So he took it back to exchange it for the cheeseburger he ordered. Then he was served a meat patty with cheese on a bun. When he asked about the missing lettuce and tomato, as shown on the menu, the manager insisted on refunding his money, and said he had to leave or she would call security.

CV05rBOr5DdDGvxUZkRFmg,Huge fan of Kimpton- came for Merchant and Trade, but were told we needed reservations. Went to dinner instead. Service was spotty but it's opening night.  Queen City salad delicious, full of flavor.  Branzino crudo -very strange dish, components never melded together and I LOVE crudo!!   Husband's risotto ok, lacked flavor and not really risotto, just rice with a leek sauce.  Shared broccolini, overly salty taleggio cheese & too much salt- broccolini way over roasted (burnt, really),2017-11-01,hIHqsskaLCBSgUzBePus8w,
