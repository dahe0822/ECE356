zDKH2ua2DauqiWOAP9yz7g,For the amount of money paid, increase the portion size. It doesn't have to be a huge increase but for $10 I expected a little more slaw and a thicker burger,2015-05-06,EgA6sMKj6xobNMoPrbiJOQ,

aisuiJvni7FNMezu5seAHw,Our air went out late one night so I called Mark after his company was recommended to me by a co-worker.  Mark had his tech, Luke, out 4 hours after the call.  Luke was awesome and diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes.  The repair was done quickly and the price was very fair.  Not once did Luke or Mark try to sell me anything extra.  Both guys were very down to earth and knowledgable. I will definitely call Everest for any further repairs.,2017-06-16,iFCXAFaEfPIhJc9CjQfHBQ,

lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw,Horrible place to visit. We ordered 3 w\/ 1 being the mushroom & vegetable sizzler w\/ Schezuan sauce. The mushroom & vegetable sizzler came w\/ no mushrooms. When we told the server, she just got us some mushrooms on the side & said here you go. The owner didn't even apologize. He was convincing us dat we didn't miss out on anything. Y should I pay $20 for something which is not even half of what I ordered? Also too much sauce on the food making it difficult to taste anything else. Waste of money.,2015-12-28,WSfooHvv7T2LzhdazOucLw,

Di5QdSiP0Kd20abQvRSiTw,Ja , so ist es , Mut und Qualit√§t wird belohnt . Nun habe ich auch den oberen  Raum im Michel kennen gelernt , sehr geeignet f√ºr kleine und mittlere Veranstaltungen . Und er ist ebenso liebevoll dekoriert und eingerichtet , wie unten ,hier ist bedeutend mehr Platz f√ºr Tische und Menschen . Ich bin wieder am k√∂stlichen Jim Knopf Burger h√§ngen geblieben ( er k√∂nnte einen Tick w√§rmer sein ) mit den super - leckeren S√º√ükartoffel Frites und einem Salat Sch√ºsselchen . Schmeckt nach mehr !! Bis bald !,2016-08-11,mHqroxeDrncDqZGBA74WHw,

Rg8PqyyoJmTaYx-OHpxFfg,Be aware of the opening hours of the clinic and the actual time doctors show up to the clinic. I came here on a Saturday because the website says it is open at 9am. I was the first one and 50 minutes later I am still waiting for the doctor to show up so I can be seen. Waiting to be seen because of volume is one thing but waiting for the doctors to show up at the advertised hours of business is another.,2015-07-04,V_itycuUjtCzwwFB2aX3hA,

Joseph described for us a new concoction he created called the Walter White (you have to have seen Breaking Bad to appreciate the namesake). If yo want the perfect espresso drink to get you going or keep you going, give this deliciously invigorating drink a try. Espresso with a touch of Carmel and a hint of chocolate rounded off with a little cream, this drink is divine.  For other adventures, check out this little gem of a cafe.,2015-11-28,e4uyqSXaYcjq8bCUowMFkA,

TaEASKZil0TT7CAzyqFUgw,Awesome atmosphere, good drinks, but the food is mediocre at best. The wait was long (probably because it's still new). The service was slow. They quoted us 1.5 hours on a Thursday evening. When we got seated, it took more than 15 mins for our server to get to us.  For what it is, it's incredibly overpriced. I'd much rather get good quality food from a local business, but it'd be a cool place to go for a night out - their drinks are pretty strong.,2017-07-13,og-vD9plC5tinlV74Ohndg,

First comment was no sauerkraut on hot dogs how dare they. Next thing I noticed when we got into the restaurant were herded in as cattle and then I paid to much. Double a hamburger tasted very bland. The fries were very salty I could taste the salt before the fries and hamburgers. I taste the condiments before the hamburger.,2013-11-24,gS_FgHvJ3O8oUA4qD2dDaA,

zWBx1yK3R0JLtP22KSDo1Q,Engage your lower abdominals during your daily activities.

I felt like a ""number"" and felt the crew could take lessons from the employees at Frost in Gilbert. The ice cream is delish though as the fam loved the Island Fudge (with Coconut on top), Mint Chocolate Chip and Moose Tracks.

F6c3D1o9Z4Tl6cDorb3WgA,Definitely a great place for fast dining and healthy options! I got a kale-quinoa-avocado salad for $7 and it was definitely quite a hefty portion! I also ordered a side of homemade fries, and although they were a little greasy for me, the taste was delicious. We struggled to find seating though since it was crowded, and I would say it is not a very conducive atmosphere for anything more than a casual meet up. This is my first time here, and I definitely will be coming again.,2016-01-02,zY0qiXv9ca4-903O2RmVYQ,

0odAupWjDV8gwhaLqyh1-A,IMPORTANT! this place closes at 9pm- not 10pm as posted here. We had a terrible experience here- we went out of our way to go to THIS location because they were ""open"" until 10. Instead we received terrible service and were turned away at 9pm!! Note- people were still inside eating and there was still food on the line. They have a terrible rating anyway which we sadly failed to check out before- I wish we had check because it would have saved us quite the hassle.,2016-07-16,D2DQvXzLFTi-MJBtvgx0tA,

N_2yEZ41g9zDW_gWArFiHw,The ice cream is NOT GOOD. It melts so fast, while you are eating it you are creating a mess! You need a lot of tissue and one cup when you eat the ice cream. Ok, I get they're business idea of making an unique ice cream, but they are trying too hard.The ice cream just full of sugar and cream. When you are eating your hands are sticky, it's so easy to drip on your shirt, and you just don't feel good.  just because it's all over Instagram and Twitter, doesn't mean it's good.,2015-09-22,sgLcwunZZNZgdprC9FJwKA,

68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,Flock & Fowl has been serving the hungry chicken masses for near two years out of a humble 8 table restaurant. Recently featured in USA Today, Food & Wine Magazine, and the Las Vegas RJ, the restaurant can be quite busy mid-shift, so arriving closer to opening or after 2PM will yield a much higher success for parties larger than 4 getting sat and fed quickly. Typically, all ordering happens at register with the entire party arrived and ready to be fed. New larger location expected by year's end.,2017-07-07,b3cssGUI0x0w12L7yM1yLw,

Tell folks to come in and shop for broken junk in watermelon bins. Bob was way shady and sweaty, this place had annoying techno music to get you to shop, if you want to pass out? Just head towards the music, cause the air doesn't move near there. Bob, stop lying and get some A\/C in that place already!!!!,2017-07-26,JVHhbEdsqLQeOZc0Z9trsA,

They had a suburban and that was the type I was looking for. So I went there to see if I can get it or not so they got all of the information from me and my wife. Then the next day they wanted me and my wife to come down. So after work we went their just to find out that we was not approved to get the vehicle.

They will ignore you and not provide the same service as large groups. They will also seat you in the bar instead of the actual restaurant. This is not only annoying, it's uncomfortable and made me feel like an outcast.

gHMkTOvq89eNuVxnpF444w,I would give the Q a solid 3 of 5 stars. I had the wings and mac and cheese and a side of deviled eggs. The wings themselves were pretty good but the jerk sauce is definitely some crappy store bought concoction. The wings were a better than average size. The mac and cheese well lets just say its not. A greesy oily clump of noodles with burnt fried cheese on top. Yeah its that bad. The deviled eggs are definitely not your grandma's eggs but hey at least the plate presentation was on point.,2016-03-02,7gr43o1AijunYd5h1gKrmQ,

G-u14MaU6ymd0gZoNX3mAQ,Love this place. Vibe is always positive and music is always good. A venue for having a drink and listening to some jams. Usually too loud to carry on a conversation so not good for a first date unless you both love music. Only tried some of the food but everything I remember was delicious. 'Popcorn shrimp' is actually popcorn with shrimp in it - cute. Hesitant to give a positive review because I love how I always get a seat...

All said, I would say that Foxy is an OK, high-end neighborhood spot, except it is OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced. Much better eats in the city for the price point.,2017-07-03,o3tcqVPfaOVMpoZ_9v0V2Q,

The Belt Buckle (Brisket atop waffle fries with drippings and Bama sauce) and God sauce are my absolute favorites. Not to mention the fantastic service and dedication from owners, Mike and James, and from staff such as Brandon and Shane.,2016-03-12,kocSktxgnlI_E9g5fovT2g,

So that's why I love coming here at Today Nails because they get the best employees to work for them.

Got a ham, egg and cheese croissant sandwich, side of fruit, orange juice combo and a chai tea latte. The sandwich was ok, nothing special, the fruit iMessage in ripe and crunchy, juice was good and the latte lacked flavor.. Had had much better at Dunkin Donuts surprisingly. For $12, I'm unsure if I'll return.,2016-02-09,0Fugg7nd-6mbdYVMNNpwtA,

ORp9PRTDtalvEGL19Wco-Q,M&J Eastside Deli has great pastrami sandwiches and their burgers are fantastic. Everything is made in-house. The pastrami is cured on site. The burger meat is ground when an order is placed and is cooked to perfection. The fries are cut from whole potatoes and even the bread and buns are homemade. Check the hours though as they sometimes change. Seating is also sometimes limited. In spite of that, M&J gets 5 Stars from me. Try the pastrami.  You'll love it.,2017-01-28,67rF7Sq_ooUirc6kcFW6MQ,

51lFCPpAZz4t7-BrpLHf5g,Ordered their chicken, spaghetti and corn.  The chicken was really juicy and i was salavating for a taste, sadly though there was no taste, it was bland bland bland.  No salt even.  The corn tasted like it was from a can and although the spaghetti portion was large, the noodles were over cooked and soft to the point of almost mushy.  In my opinion, not worth the hype and if you want flavour go elsewhere.,2017-08-03,yvcZN7H2pmeGXMV2pHpozw,

cjatara6LkXRu2BXD_jxlA,First time here at this location.  As a semi self serve  restaurant, i believe its a decent place to enjoy your dinner or whatever the case is. Why i say semi self serve? well they had good attitudes and serves you food, BUT all drinks are self serve. which is not a big deal. Water is free(water bottles). I tired Lamp,Chicken wings, and Chicken Joints Skewers. Taste decent! not bad at all. Great idea on the idea of a heat table (my picture). Environment is decent, dim light good music.,2016-06-04,TjvVhw2s9fesdFbBg_DiiQ,

OlBFLXVJfze2ZZA4UUBS0g,Worst place ever because their service is horrible. As soon as it's the slightest bit busy they no longer see you as a human and consider you just a number. No one approaches or welcomes you to take your order so it is very easy to get lost in the shuffle. They won't think twice about casting you to the side and losing your business. Makes you question why you should even bother since it's for crappy mall-quality food.,2016-03-30,krJw8HFQMl2lP8fbHvEGuw,

Also if you are into gel nails and all, their prices are too expensive and for a new place they are very inflexible.

4yAvytbVKHqSYAo3mkI9OA,Amazing, amazing. I always order the chicken skewers. I am a guy who mostly tries to eat organic and that chicken seriously tastes organic. I know it likely is not because they don't market it as such; but that chicken is so firm and fresh and does not taste frozen at all. The seasonings they use are second to none and are just perfect. I love this place!!,2016-12-22,Me1OtqThVoRLpOxZ7lhzuw,

ym4zQit5BHrOk53lk8dFJg,This is the best gelato\/icecream place I have ever been to in my life. The flavours are VERY innovative. They have different and special flavoured popsicle everyday!! I personally like the Pear so much, it tasted exactly like a pear! Not even lying!! Also, the price is always $5 which is very reasonable and worth it! TRUST ME! Everyone would fall in love with it instantly once you have tried this place! But, the SADDEST thing is they close for winter season, gona have to wait for next year now:(,2017-10-11,OuBm0ttdoJw7PjnnB-4cgw,

I think this is because the employees are dancing, singing, and really having a great time goofing off in full view of all of the patiently waiting customers.  If there are 5 people behind the counter, typically 2-3 are dancing and chatting it up, leaving 2-3 employees to handle the long lines alone.  Every time.

The worst. Also, our table was right between the bar and wait station with the traffic pattern right next to it. Felt very noisy and like we were in the middle of a train station.

c52Nn_nFu4wQ3-iQfB0VyA,This place was an absolute life saver. I shattered my iPhone 6 phone screen and the display no longer worked. I went to the Apple Store and they turned me away and I tried to get a replacement phone from my provider and that didn't work either. I walked into ubreakifix and they had my phone completely fixed within the hour (and it was on a Sunday--when nobody else was even open). They had to replace my LCD screen along with the glass so it was a little more expensive but 100% worth it.,2016-07-24,HMJfqpEKNa5R0bjcaJes6A,

Also, when it comes to stage, dancers that don't have a license, can't take any clothing off, and new girls don't know what to do. If you ever go back ask for jewels, Julie, autumn, Mary Jane, or Dakota. I've seen them dance, they take clothes off, very nice, and they don't ""rip you off"".

AbsHo7Gk6fYHv99CmsWXnQ,Got a coupon from Groupon. Everytime I call, there was no answer. Finally the lady called me back and was able to get an appointment. She said she will call the day before to confirm, but did not call. On the day of the appointment, I called them again. Still no answer. I left several messages in the voicemail. Left emails. The website (which is now put down) does not have a specific address, only says ""Pickering"". Good thing Groupon gave me a refund.,2017-03-29,BW8xsDrWJoDm_gQ01xxtYQ,

zc0sUY7iWuJB93AHWKy_xw,The one in Columbus is awesome! So we were excited that they were opening one here! Quality was great at first, but has gone downhill.  Food isn't quite as tasty and much to my disappointment, they changed their fries.  They used to be thin and crispy and were a must have every time I ate there. Now they are thicker and mushy.  They are fine but nothing amazing about them.  They also changed their point system, causing us to lose 300+ points.  They never followed up after we complained.,2017-12-02,z-13FoXWp5CB_fxHTHuNrw,

Food quality and service can fluctuate wildly depending on time of day, but if you sit at the bar, order drinks and maybe an app while watching a game, you'll have fun. The patio is nice, but realize that they are usually blasting commercial country songs through the outdoor, sometimes making conversation difficult.

0qayzrNKvLTzRYbZvcKPAg,I've been going to the same nail place for over 3 years religiously every two weeks. I came to tiki nail bar after a friend told me she went to their grand opening. Kim was the first one here she is very sweet and helped me find a match for gel and regular polish for my toes which can be so difficult if it's not ""perfect match"". Most importantly she did an amazing job on my nails I will definitely come back and send a few friends over! Thanks Kim,2016-10-05,LJ5LVla3coDMhY9iYm9VNA,

When I said it was my first time in and I wanted more information, I was passed off to another girl who said I need to sign up for emails. This place is supposed to offer meal plans, but as far as I was told nothing is dealt with at the actual store, all ordering and meals are made at and shipped from corporate. If I'm looking to spend  $100+ a week, I expect a courteous, knowledgeable staff.,2017-06-23,INtZQ0e0RgeIg5vZKPWiVQ,

Do walk-in or take your gamble.      *Honestly, OTHERWISE, they have decent pizza. Try their Canadian bacon.

(They are not affiliated with COSTCO, a store that actually cares about its customers).

It's made of cheap plastic and broke in the same spot twice, I had to BUY a new bumper and then that one broke. It's such a problem that they actually sell replacement bumpers, they don't replace them you have to buy a new one for $6 every time it breaks. Until they can come up with a redesign bumper STAY AWAY, not worth the money.,2017-03-23,iGZ6vxCbbceMc16Y9Z4rGw,

mVomtOMgBxbGvdPSaF2HjQ,Very disappointing visit to their new location.  We had gone several times to their original location and the cookies were delicious.  We decided to try their new location on Friday because we read that they would be serving coffee to go along with their cookies.  Needless to say, that wasn't the case.  No coffee.  No working bathroom.  My all-time favorite cookie, chocolate chip, was small, overpriced at $1.99, and tasted like it came from a bag of Chips Ahoy, which probably would taste better.,2017-04-15,Itwv3ycYgVk8LF4uW-W6cg,

The plate comes with chopped up iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and didn't include the usual tabule, pickled turnip, pickles, onions and no garlic sauce.

Food looked gross. $10 for what is described as ""homemade"" guacamole, which is served in a tiny dish. Ouch.,2015-08-30,lWSZULrLk-RJaYhzSoKqWA,

pVJ1g_-Pbc4LkjMUUaLADw,First time visiting this place and did not like it one bit. 1st off they didn't honor their promotion on restaurant.com.  I was suppose to get $25 off on a $50 tab. The waitress and manager seem to not know the promotion. He had to call the owner, Frank, which he didn't honor the deal. Instead, he offered me 20% off I was like that's not the same as the promotion. Their food is way over priced. They say they sell sushi but it's not on the menu. This place just opened get it together Int'l Bistro,2017-08-16,h334e8R_TpDaj3YUKV81-w,

KaUB34enSO-stij40-n9dQ,Girlfriends and I decided to try this place out. 1st- server tried her best just lack of experience and no other person offered to help her. 2nd- Food took way to long. One plate at a time 3rd- Food was nothing to talk about. No shrimp. No pulled pork. Fried mushrooms cost me 9.00!! 4th- No Ac. It was hot! I can say the poor server tried her best but overall.hot mess!! And the hot sauce bottle had so much crust around the top we refused to use it.I hope they learn fast before they are shut down.,2017-11-11,XGeRa1YOiM1yCmjT2SJZkw,

FTDljmduViAYBqrNEQx3fA,Food was average. I paid more than avg $$ and what I got was bowl full of quinoa and barely any zucchini. Eggplant and broccoli were no where to be found. The rest, it was a generous portion no complaints. It did taste good. But for I paid I expect slightly more zucchini. All over disappointed.

It was a meat patty on a bun. So he took it back to exchange it for the cheeseburger he ordered. Then he was served a meat patty with cheese on a bun. When he asked about the missing lettuce and tomato, as shown on the menu, the manager insisted on refunding his money, and said he had to leave or she would call security.
