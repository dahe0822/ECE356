Here's a tip- Bring some bottles of booze with you so you can make your own drinks in your room before spending a fortune at the bars! We always stop by a place called Office Bar (which is a half mile from the airport on the way to the Strip) and buy a few bottles before checking into our hotel.

Disgusting rooms, came to an uncleared room with half used shampoo bottles, no bar of soaps, broken fridge AND lamp and HORRIBLE customer service throughout the entire hotel.... I think the people who work their hate their jobs just as much as I hated this place. Sometimes customer service makes up for any inconveniences but not this place. Don't be fooled by the pictures, they look nice but it's disgusting.,2013-06-08,cskst1HceqTQJks-nlifkQ,

5Zc41a446gV3K_o7CDs69Q,The Riviera needs to be shut down honestly, it is old, out-dated, and smells of sewer and Cigarette smoke. Even for its low price ppl deserve better.  My boyfriend and I checked in on nov.24th 2013 only to check back out a hr or two later.  The pillows was covered in slob and smelled of morning breath, heat didnt wrk and it was cold and rainy that week.  Plz dnt stay here Staff was nice tho!

Instead you have to reverse out and go back to the machine on the first floor,  if you only have cash on you,  which is a huge inconvenience!

cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g,I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was way too spicy and the meat was not at all flavorful or contained any distinguishing spice or good taste. I had to add a ton of salt to make it taste relatively edible. The fries looked nice, but they too were bland. Shake # 4 is delicious- then the custard messes it all up. The service was polite and friendly, but it was just not worth it. May I also add that the funky ketchups are way too ambitious at being funky. It just tastes weird.,2013-06-17,hm4vqJi6bIF9SVnYGAOTXQ,

Ta9m6G8P0pA5nuAJomjQqQ,Nylon ball bearing rollers really increase the operation of your door. Stock rollers are plastic, (generally black) and unless lubricated on a consistent basis, they sqeak a high pitch and dont turn well, or sometimes not at all. Upgrading to a nylon ball bearing roller will allow the door to roll freely. The bearings are packed w\/ grease so there is no maintenance. The sqeaks are no longer.,2013-08-15,noVEFdHrJ3QiulPcSnMHdQ,

Ta9m6G8P0pA5nuAJomjQqQ,Photo eyes are a common problem on your operator system. They need to be aligned, or your electric operator will not go down. The LED lights on your photo eyes should be constantly lite with no flickering. If they are blinking, flickering or not on at all, they are out of alignment. However, you can override the safety system by keeping constant pressure on the wall button, but you must have those lights on solid or the operator will not go down ;),2015-03-28,noVEFdHrJ3QiulPcSnMHdQ,

u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ,This place has the worst customer service. They don't care about the customer or loyalty at all. They just take your money and run. Do not stay here. Also don't believe what the website tells you when you book your room. It's a complete lie. They give you whatever is left over in terms of room type.,2013-01-09,D2xWVq38NQOJXlbhAbgLHA,
u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ,This hotel continues on its downward spiral. It is obvious that the management team does not care and it shows. Now to add insult to injury they are now charging a ""resort fee"" of $ 20 a night. All for hotel rooms that a motel 6 could beat in cleanliness. I witnessed a room service tray sit in the hallway for over 36 hours. Stay away from here or severely lower your expectations. It is sad.

I was told the salad would feed 2, but $15 for lettuce and onions is ridiculous. The marinara wasn't good either. Just so you know, they don't make orders for one so there's lots leftover, and I don't really want to eat it and I love Italian food! Disappointing,2015-10-23,X0T4DS54Foaic83zGHePuQ,

owLXnEhlMLsFpemYoOxNkg,Very disappointing. Many hotel in Vegas, avoid this one. Hidden additional fees, very noisy AC in the room. We payed extra fees to get around the pool and for a balcony which we didn't had. NON smoking room had a strong cigarette smells and our key door was working one time ouf of 20. Beware: hotwire mention free Internet access but its 14$ to have it in the room. Its only free at the bar. For all our problems, the staff told us, there is nothing we can do to help , it's a not our fault.,2013-06-08,JbyMc9-80NeTRcg_c4cdHg,

MHgCSMjjLBa11ul2as6dpw,This authentic restaurant is one of my favorite. It is a ""bring your wine"" concept and It's located 3 buildings to a SAQ (place where you buy alcools in Qu√©bec) so pass by the SAQ before! Rolls, soup and papaya salad are awesome. Best PadThai in Montr√©al. Warning: you can only pay cash, but there are ATM nearby. Enjoy this great family own restaurant  :),2013-07-31,JbyMc9-80NeTRcg_c4cdHg,

ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw,The absolute worst buffet I've ever been to in Vegas (wicked spoon, wynn and aria are better.... Even Rio and Paris and planet hollywood are better).

My bf and I sat in the bar and I could see the bartender wiping his nose\/ touching cash\/wiping the counter without washing his hands before making drinks. It upset me so much because we had both ordered drinks we no longer wanted after seeing this. ALSO the waitress who was topping the cocktails wiped her hands on her pants then touched the toppings with her bare hands, gross. Not the best experience.

EgemRE83Qe_ZbGnFcrPsng,This place is a joke.The office staff is rude. A new management company took over and raised my rent $150 a month for nothing! It has taken 10 months to fix my dishwasher. Do not waste your hard earned money here. I have black mold growing on a wall in my unit. When pointed out to maintenance, I was told it was not as he wiped it off. I went to the office to advice them and was told the manager was not there. I am seeking legal council at this point. Many other tenants are too.,2014-04-17,4dQzmzjmoQO3PNdB5jS-0w,
EgemRE83Qe_ZbGnFcrPsng,I have created maintenance requests. They have been closed out with out the work being done. The BLACK mold is still on my wall although I try to clean it with bleach. I have gone in the office to complain only to be told the manager is not there. In order to change my mind a lot must be done. If that is not possible reporting to the state housing authority and or legal action may be required. We were happy here until the new management took over.

mxXt56_UdRQCHB1kftx5lw,Do not rent here. The manager is rude. I just found out that he never applied my renters insurance policy to my account. He did not respond to my request to speak to him when my account was not charged correctly and now will not remove the late fees or renters insurance fee. The previous owner was pleasant. I will never rent from Life Storage again as there is ""no one else to speak to."" I find it hard to believe there is no leadership above this man.,2015-11-06,4dQzmzjmoQO3PNdB5jS-0w,

eboFGTFO2UVdLLgTgiEkmA,Mailboxes here have been broken into 5 times in 3 years. The gate up front in front of the mailboxes is forever broken and management doesn't care enough to fix it. And don't bother complaining about not feeling safe having mail sent to your place. Management will promptly tell you how they are new and just ""don't know"". Oh and calling Trinity is pointless, that's just leaving a voicemail for a person who will never call you back. Your money is better spent elsewhere.,2014-01-11,NyE1Hj_BagcgHc3o-kibKg,

SSqpD2OWQS2IzntxwTnZMQ,Their ""gym"" is a closet size room. One of the repair men stole my iPod when they came to do a repair. There is a horrible roach\/bug problem. Our AC kept breaking down. I'd call every couple weeks to have it fixed But they still can't fix it right. The repair men will report to the office anything goin on in your apt. Anything to charge you a fee. Yansie is the only nice office lady. We got evicted out of the blue so they could remodel just to up the rent. The apartments aren't worth the price.,2016-09-01,QJ7thkHO0067zCIqfuIh6g,

Z6PHrbbjuUyaRqc5cauWNg,Know your vehicle auction value, trade value and retail value before you negotiate a trade. They offer low wholesale. Then offer about 8% lower than sticker price if it's a pre owned vehicle your buying. Walk out of they don't take the deal. End of the month is the best time to negotiate. Read my entire review.

When a professional estimator comes and they are commissioned then you may want to check to see if your not being quoted to much.

zUbqJk1KtbMnStiMfrMegA,Just redecorated by someone with less taste than before. It was a modern design. Now they are appealing to older new yorkers. Subway tile behind the prep counter. Brown square tile looks like residential homedepot tile. Old lights like 1945. They lost some seating to a huge new refrigerator. Got rid of a nice sseating bench and sepeerate tables on the west walls and replaced it with a big community table. Fire those responcable.

zsQk990PubOHjr1YcLkQFw,As far as banh mi sandwiches in Vegas, it's not my favorite place, but it's cheaper and the sandwiches are bigger AND filled with more meat than my favorite spot so I can't complain. The bread is extremely fresh, but has a very crispy crust, which I hate. The meat is slightly less flavorable than Mr Sandwich but again theres tons more of it. All in all a great value in a hidden gem but not enough to get me to stop my nearly daily visits to Mr Sandwich,2013-04-01,iFWgzHILqm2W_tKWyr44lg,

This was far and away the best lunch I've ever had, and I'm a burger, fries, streak sandwich kind of guy.  Usually there's no such thing as ""too spicy"" for me, but the regular spicy was spicy enough. I can't imagine what the ""killer spicy ramen"" had in store...,2013-05-23,iFWgzHILqm2W_tKWyr44lg,

ko1v9-BdTqZQWmx4DIHWaw,Dolphins, lions, tigers belong in the wild with their family, not confined in a tank or a cage. They're not happy! Animals are taken from the wild, have make shift families and are starved unless they do tricks for us. When's the last time you saw a dolphin paint a picture in the wild?Or when did a tiger jump through a ring of fire? Please make a compassionate choice and say no to animal entertainment.,2014-02-24,Fr1AHwaEhj1zryGBR49Z5Q,

This is a picture on my milkshake right when they handed it it me - the top tip of the whipped cream didn't even come close to the top of the cup.

They aren't condescending and spend time with you as needed. They examine your pets in front of you so you know they are being taken care of.,2014-05-05,Gp3FXWXyRiESqGfh0y7WYA,

vl1aHp6pvnSmpoRQShWLjg,The appetizers and sides are delicious! In terms of meat and sauce....I say Famous Dave's has them beat on the pulled pork, chicken and ribs. Coleslaw is fresh and yummy but I prefer the extra kick Famous Dave's slaw offers with the horseradish. The rib tips were great as long as there wasn't too much sauce on them. The deserts looked amazing but we were far too full to try. The biscuits beat corn bread any day! If you're at the Red Rock Lucielle's or The Yard House is the way to go for sure.,2013-08-24,pJH0Bero-arrvKDIMOTCUw,

TeggG3duunpoy__1Y2SAyQ,Each time I get their laulau, I fall in love with it even more! Majority of their dishes are decent and filling - huge portions! I believe the prices are too little for the amount of portions they give, which is a thumbs up. The only down side is that their noodles can be a little too salty. Overall, everything else is worth the try!,2015-10-17,sJSoIxozv3DHPUvmDSdsTg,
zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,I'm a big fan of seafood so I enjoyed devouring everything at this place. However, their mild spicy can be a little more than mild. Also, I didn't really like how the potatoes were not cut into wedges. That would've been easier to eat. Their chicken wings were cooked PERFECTLY. It was a little crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. I got the snow crab because the lobster was $20\/lb, which was a little too pricy. But the snow crab was just as satisfying!,2015-11-04,sJSoIxozv3DHPUvmDSdsTg,

jN5rqu2Pe2CwApk3SbFoZQ,One of the worst places and areas in Vegas to live. Management lets everyone in. Lots of druggies, homeless everywhere, and dangerous happenings at least once a week.

0G1y7uV7w1D2uziS4Lt_Dw,I gave this place a wonderful review about a year ago. Lately, they've hired a new cashier to work the busiest times, on Friday through Sunday. This person has repeatedly messed up money. First I got overcharged on my card & my server had to apologize & reimburse me. Then I was given someone else's credit card & who knows where mine went? Today I had to ask for change from my server. I finally get my change from the cashier with an attitude for dessert. After over 20 minutes.,2017-11-24,1LAaJpirIAhlOMIuQSbHiw,

Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,The Cadillac Margarita was amazing but too strong for my taste. The Strawberry Margarita was delicious; definitely recommended for those of us who do not like the taste of liquor. Lol. As for the food, I wasn't very impressed; too expensive for what you get. The meats [steak, chicken & lobster] were all overcooked. The highlight of the meal was the salsa served with chips & the hand-made tortillas. I would be inclined to visit again if their prices were a little lower.,2013-05-25,nReXS3VKb0aZPY4klM37VQ,

Sovgwq-E-n6wLqNh3X_rXg,Whent to this restaurant on a Saturday night.  The place was good, had nice atmosphere. The waiter was nice and on top of our refills. The down side was that our waiter forgot to place our order to the cook so it took about 20min to get our food.  Then when we got our food he brought me the wrong plate.  At this point I did not want to wait another 10-20 min for a new plate.,2013-07-07,uZbCCaO43ayq705KoA_EKg,

VzekjBEdqFdJsXEOWInA1A,First time trying their pizza last weekend. I just got a medium pepperoni. Delivery arrived 30 min later. Okay, being a Boston pizza fan, I'll really give my honest opinion. First dough: excellent. Nice taste, soft and fluffy... just the way I like it. Pizza sauce: below average... either it's already made or their pizza sauce is really bland. Cheese: for some reason really heavy. I give a 5 outta 10 overall on their pizza,2015-07-28,FvFGoFrfVuaw-ZLI39uccA,

They have horrible 1810 style blinds with no shade covering them and a bright light shining outside every window (for security I was told) so you cannot sleep without light in the room.  Just when the lights shut off, the sun rises and the room is filled with light.  In a town where you need to sleep late, this is a horrible design.

xn2wBz0SmCo5J6y10NK5ew,I took my 10-year-old son here for the first time. Not one person said hello from the receptionist to the triage nurse to the nurse assigned to us in the ER room. Them when my son was scared when he found he needed a blood test, the nurse aggressively told him his age and asked if he ""wanted to live or die"". And this was the pediatric track!

I stopped in at the Ted Wiens on Flamingo & 215 and was quoted a price for a front rotor resurface. But their wait was long, so I drove to the Eastern location. Who quoted me $20 dollars more than their other location. When I asked them if all Ted Wiens locations were same price he said yes and he could not honor their misquote.  So an entire day wasted at ted Wiens.,2013-08-13,InAm0yBAuyyBJZETrYlAvg,

There is loud barking all hours of morning and night, dog fights daily and a lot owners don't clean up after their pets so it smells.,2012-10-19,ezUeK6MNj-I9WDNJ0YLv-A,
4RuvoRz8FecCb5lVCz2uOw,I live here for a year now, whats really I didnt like is they never change our carpet since we moved! Dirty and stinky carpet, we asked of they can change it but they said thry only change it if we move out and someone will rent it! Ridiculous! A lot of cockroaches on our patio as well! Nasty! Parking enforcement is sucks! Theyll give u a notice if your car doesnt have a dmv sticker etc. Ill just finish my lease and will never live here again! A lot of apartments there that much better!,2013-07-20,oS26UKwxKFZ35PkQLpv3Gw,

fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A,Horrible service and would advise everyone to stay away. I don't eat any meat or seafood so I checked the menu at the hostess stand upon arrival. I asked the server if the tofu had any sauce on it because I don't eat meat. Nope just tofu and soy sauce I was told. Tofu had shrimp in it which I are a small bit of. If I had been allergic I would be dead. The server said well it's a seafood restaurant! Morons. It should be on the menu or told to patrons when they ask.

The wait is not long at all if you just walk in. They are quick but they do a great job! I came here before I got married then started going somewhere else closer to my house but man- I WAS CRAZY! I am glad I started coming back here. :),2014-07-23,ADZbVX8qeN9oFV2U-2NbOw,
