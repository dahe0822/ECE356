They also add the sherry table side so you control the amount. One note, even though Yelp says they are not open on Saturdays we found out this is not in fact the case. Hopefully they update Yelp so others do not skip Saturday dinning.,2015-09-11,4_9XePI3VxiT6puthbAUfQ,

2aONsfo6bi9BWR6-MF1g3A,It's a beautiful club.  Of course the women are not professionally trained dancers.  It's a strip club in Phoenix, AZ; not a Broadway production in NYC. The lap dancers are hired based on their ability to look good while nearly naked. The negatives- it's way too dark & I don't understand why any strip club would have more than one stage.  That is bad for business.,2016-04-16,6VQhukVLm4vB4D12qG8Ebg,

bphFS_7xYag4Dv_6d8fmVQ,If it takes 24 hours to get the results of a criminal background check, why do they allow  everyone to move in with in five minutes of filling out an application? When Bill was here he made sure it was safe. Now the cops are here 3 times a day on average and there is at least one instance per day of a fire truck coming here. I guess that is for the drug over doses. The city of Phoenix should fine the hell out of this horrible slum Lord for being a menace to the community.,2014-10-23,6VQhukVLm4vB4D12qG8Ebg,
bphFS_7xYag4Dv_6d8fmVQ,Now that Bill is gone, the criminals are back. It sucks! There are still some decent people left with families. They are obviously poor and\/or have bad credit.

XC06xxb7FFYsXcI2E38IIw,Was here last week and raved about the half chicken and ahi tuna.  Today we had the spinach and artichoke dip which is always good and I had the ding chicken sandwich.  The slaw on the sandwich overpowers the taste of the chicken which when eaten without the slaw was rather thin and a little dry.  Hillstone Tends To Over salt their fries and this afternoon lunch was no different.   I understand the need to juice their fruit in house but the lemonade is way too tart!,2014-08-12,kUADOBnw0dwBx9YRfbQL1w,

I needed coffee so pulled my car into the drive thru, to see girls in thong bikinis :) kind of giggled to myself.  Nice girls that are paying through college. But I can't help but feel bad that I got a coffee this way. Something I just feel torn on. Coffee wasn't bad but I don't know if I will be back. Just felt kind of degrading.,2016-05-10,f2khae8dcsyeX4YE9TWnLQ,

RNi6tW22UMgHwWLAb0mYdA,Considering that it's the Holiday season, i was surprised that we were seated in less than 15 minutes with a last minute reservation called in an hour earlier. Spinning salad is part of the meal, and Lawry's Yorkshire English pudding is to die for...soft, light and hot. Ladies, if this is your first time at Lawry's with your Date, you cant go wrong with the 6 oz.California Cut. The next best one is the 10 oz. Lawry's Cut. 16 oz. Diamond Jim Brady with the boner. I meant, bone-in.,2014-12-27,SINvtxMBnvzsOhvD71haUQ,

I had to get up and find a server to get our second round of drinks,  then we had to ask for bread which should had been on the way to the table  after placing  order. Service was mediocre at  best, had to ask for salt and pepper after plates came to table. I  expected service to march the price.  Overall experience, not impressed, I  can't say that I  would recommend to anyone.,2015-05-25,Tf1ldDLUMfjoeiEq5niRqg,

They know about wings and should know better than that,  I asked server to please reheat them at least and they did.  Wings were as warm as should be but,  they did not bring half of the flavors that I had ordered, and that's where wings at native became like a box of chocolates I did not know what I was getting.

9HDU4onlEZU27fUbF-m7wA,This is my first visit here, I ordered the beef molcajete since I am a big fan of them.  Let's start with the molcajete itself,  made of stone and piping hot, great job on that.  Second,  presentation,  bubbling but shredded cheese on top instead of cheese blocks or logs. Third,  taste,  great spice but,  a sweet taste to the dish, should not be sweet. I will return to try the steaks,  they look amazing and the smell is incredible.,2017-10-11,Tf1ldDLUMfjoeiEq5niRqg,

8Syk4yZRivDlVUdXxIPutQ,Went three times. First time the pre made corn enchilada was dry and tasteless. Can't get enchilada in flour tortilla as food is all pre made. Not FRESH. Soda doesn't taste right think generic brand. All three times  food very poor quality . Only thing worse is arrogant rude Manager. No credit cards Cash Only Anyone wonder about that? I went down the street to Garcia's. Excellent food, Value and Fabulous service.  Resturant clean and Manager that is polite.,2013-03-30,HNRybq_TH3KUgn3zbedu9w,
8Syk4yZRivDlVUdXxIPutQ,I agree with Elizabeth H review. Food is disgusting. Tried this place three times. Food worse each time. Everything fried is soggy because preside and left to lay and rot.. WORST IN PHOENIX! Don't try to tell Rude Manager something is bad. He doesn't care and is combative. Everything  worn out from booths, uncomfortable chairs, silver wear to filthy kitchen and floors.  Cash only no cards. ATM a rip off huge fees. Soda is some flat nasty tasting generic.  Went to Garcias down the street! T,2013-03-30,HNRybq_TH3KUgn3zbedu9w,
8Syk4yZRivDlVUdXxIPutQ,? Can't understand the excellent reviews. Do I dare suggest the employees or owners are writing them? The food is dreadful. Precooked, greasy poor quality ingredients. Low quality meats and even lettuce Way past prime. Dirty dingy inside with old torn booths and chairs. Waitresses are pleasant. That doesn't change the nasty food. Don't complain to the owner manager about poor quality. He is as rude as food is nasty tasting. There were four in our party,2013-05-26,HNRybq_TH3KUgn3zbedu9w,

OamYn_r-y4sIiH1WisIqrw,Omg do people no know what size there dog it? Here is a tip. Its good to go when less people are around if u just want to get your dog out of the house. If you have a small dog like a chi. Be weary because some people think their rott or pit bull is considered a small dog or idk. But two separate areas clearly marked for large breeds or small and people can't follow rules. It sucks because I have a chi and when big dogs are around he is scared and won't play like he does with the small dogs.,2013-04-11,-7k1bbiP_NYUU_yi5zMhzg,

Your reservation is good only through the location you book & good luck getting them to answer the phone. Customer service 800 line doesn't work directly with locations you rent from. And don't worry if they try to upcharge you for days...just cancel it & rebook online for better pricing or same rate. This company will nickle and dime you.

pCdYQrJ6fhm5B_bGmH0NZA,I take my car frequently as I have a subscription for a great price. ONLY (kinda big) problem I have with this car wash is that the drying off is WAY too short.

I don't want to spend an extra 5 minutes everytime to do what I pay a monthly fee for. Please fix this issue.,2016-01-20,2CTeRtml43fde4rHArSO7A,

yoZtvhQGbZDd0FYQhcbp5g,Sugarloaf has a puppy package to help ""save money"" but I have spent around 450$ on vaccines and a microchip. I started searching around other vets when it came time to neuter my dog because sugarloaf said it would be another 450$ to do so and 350$ to have his dewclaws removed. I've found a lot of other places with vaccine packages ranging from 60 to 100$ and neutering from 50 to 75$ This place is out for money. Do not suggest it.,2016-01-04,6UyU5InMtHnX_Pci6B3TIQ,

5zHi8eQhO7sO3N15zHgkUg,Extremely disappointing experience.  Received a direct mail invitation to their Grand Opening, which offered a free item of equal or lesser value thru April 30th.  Ordered two Genghis Khan salads for take out.  We expected them to both be the same. Their offer was a blatant scam, since they put 10 shrimp in one salad and only 4 in the other or maybe their offer of a free item of lesser value was what they meant literally.  In any event, the shrimp were terrible so we threw them in the garbage,2017-04-24,5qgtsemhZ0dEJJdmjoX2SQ,
