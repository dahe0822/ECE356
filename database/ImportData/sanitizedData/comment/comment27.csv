iBCMaNm_hv9IlCDa7AWPig,This place is the best place to get Mexican Food in the valley. Their beans are fantastic and the chips and salsa are to die for! I always order extra to take some home with me. I have tried many different dishes but my favorites are the nachos with shredded chicken and my usual, the veggie burrito.

Always try the features but if you aren't feeling those, they can even make you something not on the menu to satisfy that craving. They used to have this dish on the menu but took it off and Everytime I go they make it for me!  Tagliatelle d'alba. Basically it's a pasta with truffles and mushrooms and a poached egg on top!  Not to be missed!  Try the beef carpaccio as well!  Bellissimo!,2013-04-02,32mKuGcYhdwtrB_SHnErZQ,

HhPVzZYQI-akaXRK_A4dKQ,Service in the bar is terrible on Sundays.  Today was our 2nd visit (same bartender) & i will not return.  We had to ask multiple times for beverages, my boyfriend never received his dessert, and our pizza was brought out incorrectly made & then taken away. After waiting 40 mins for our 2nd pizza the bartender comped the price of the topping and i had to get my food to go.  I left starving and disappointed.

qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,If you have any dietary restrictions or needs, check your food yourself (beyond them showing you your food) before leaving. I've ordered food vegan and, probably 75% of the time, have gotten it back with problems that make it not vegan. The kitchen staff also has a habit of wiping dairy products off of foods and containers when they make a mistake rather than remaking the dish or trashing the container. This is not acceptable.,2014-11-20,4qguccLSZEsypfPIsRbEaw,

I thought maybe I'll just walk around and someone will pop out of the corner. Nope. 5-10 minutes of browsing and not a single employee to be found. I guess I'll buy online from someone else.                                            Tip to the customer: If you need help, maybe scream real loud? Lol,2017-02-27,EkAAxp_VeF1YOXqow0F_Rg,

zg_N8jFAos1D4xeUkKUZ5A,A home repair should be defined as Jeremy The Handyman. Some reviews mentioned higher estimates. I'd rather pay to have it done the right way. We all want repairs in this manner as opposed to when other guy does it over 3 times, triples the cost, effort and results are only satisfactory. Use a professional with a huge heart, cares about his work, employees and business. Any home repairs or handyman work in general you need finished, my tip is to use these guys for everything you care about!,2017-04-18,j_2HxZ34zkwc58ztwEp5rw,

DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw,I couldn't decide between the Chicken Chipotle Avocado or the Holiday Turkey (both had great reviews on here).

So I asked for more soup, and yes, they are giving you chicken soups and it cost $3 :) sweet huh? A rice bowl size of soup cost $3.

Kj8rXSpMQlFOP2iWN0fXYA,My boyfriend and I were looking for a Mexican restaurant somewhere near Glendale and came across Anaya's. The service was great. The waitress was very helpful and attentive when need be. Both of its being from El Paso TX, we are always sceptical of Mexican restaurant and we were both very pleased. The menu has a good variety without flooding you with choices, they have a fully stocked bar and the bathrooms were very clean. Could be great for a dinner in or a quick bite to go.

oDNfrdvMV2Fq0R6vd2XwNw,This review is about lounge: we came there because price was attractive and I was sick of paying + + in every ""Deal"" in Vegas, so bottom line I loved the people working there trying to help at all times from door staff to barnan , manager asked us if we were having a good time and nobody ever asked me that in big clubs. I dont think its a place to spend all night but the great offer they have and cool vibe make it a great spot to pass by during night . I will go back for sure,2013-03-08,BZ9gwCxm7hPw8-07h7iEzQ,

uGupeWqih0yIcCg8anM1PA,a\/c works fine it just has to be turned way down. I have to go through finding out the hard way every visit. Finally set it at 62 for what was probably the equivalent to 74. House keeping turns light on between beds after service.

edPq0vpPbBYxjDrSlyAZyw,Lived here for 3 years. It was great until we got new owners. We were forced to pay an extra $850 fee that built up month to month even though they made the mistake to not put it on our bill when I would go to the front office each month to see exactly what I owed. They are making the grounds prettier just to charge more on what are mediocre apartments. The staff honestly don't seem to care about customer satisfaction. The last owners actually seemed to care about renters and their cares.,2013-06-16,6pcfw0n0c2vtu12ab1ECyA,

As a successful 30 something year old, being looked up and down, and being told ""for you it will be at least 45 mins"" is never something I want to hear. I told the hostess ""you are both unprofessional and rude"" as she smiled and my friend and I left. We are successful women, and we have money- I'm not sure what about that would make a young, awkward and unintelligent wan judge me the way she did, but it's not cute at a struggling restaurant.

The salesperson seemed unengaged and uninterested and made several mistakes during the quote-as though he would have preferred to be somewhere else.

xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ,I'd consider this the big and more mature, quite classy, version of Chipotle. The ingredients are fresh, the tortillas are excellent and homemade, and their options are more diverse. I got the salad with pulled chicken and it was excellent. However I must say, these portions are far too big for a single person. I split this with a friend and we had leftovers. A great bargain and if you do it right it can even be a great healthy option for lunch!,2013-07-03,XBQNTNhkO6V86ewbg7Lnlw,

We pulled up and saw the parking lot and valet sign with the hotel and restaurant names on it and assumed that was the best option. There was an obvious sign for $7 which was a reasonable price consistent with other garages nearby but nowhere was there a sign explaining it's really $20 for valet or we would've self parked!!

81-wh-qHg2hvwHQBjC0Q-w,We have enjoyed ownership with Worldmark for 15 years and I can say that some of their resorts quality has diminished. I haven't been to this resort in over two years and since then it has transformed itself into a mid-level Motel 6 with 4 star amenities. I brought our room (3004) condition to the attention of the concierge (Steven) who was very empathetic to the situation,  however I asked him to have the resort manager give me a call regarding this and still have not received a call!,2017-07-04,vQfdVUjw1hxPhqkkO2lwtw,

Southern California is much better.  Management hasn't a clue here.  And the place wasn't even packed!,2014-02-16,vQfdVUjw1hxPhqkkO2lwtw,

TfcQhrjJco0C_x0KVK7LwA,Make your own bloody Mary's bar is awesome. However I would sit inside vs. outside, especially during summer. Even with their amazing patio. Their mister system is not working and we ended up with ants on our table. Their service is pretty good. Amanda was pleasant and always had a smile on her face. Their food is decent for a bar. I got the California burger but sub the guac for avocado. Don't think there should be an extra charge for that though. Over all it's a decent bar for the conscience.,2013-05-19,Mc2sf6v8kQGFj-NAeRGphQ,

Order ahead and make sure to tell them to have it ready at a specific time, if you don't they won't make it until you get there. So if they tell you it'll be ready 6pm tell them you will be there at 6:05 because you need to be in and out. Good is truly amazing!,2014-07-29,SoQgpxJp_DwOg-Wb8n9Fpw,

GKZnWQ_spfnQxM3RFKypAg,Worst. hotel. ever.  The place is a dump, the staff is rude and worthless.  I was told that they ""have no quiet hours"" and there is nothing they can do about the room full of loud partying guests next to my room at 3:50am. The van drivers probably don't have licenses and gas it on yellow lights, take corners at intersections at high speeds and drive incredibly recklessly. The food choices nearby suck and the area is pretty sketchy. May want to avoid this place if at all possible.,2015-10-24,9mFoW4535-muN5nwXnXJQg,

(That isn't a mis type either 500.00 per night) I have stayed at Thrump Tower for a MUCH better room for 129.00 per night.

n1OBohcWoxxaELYjEByt6g,I see a few complaints that the boxes are Pre-made assortments. Just ask--they will happily leave out whatever you disprefer and add extra of what you request.

NPiLy71qqXzb45k9eQOgCQ,Great food to be honest but make sure you count your change! The hostesses employ a new method called ""rounding up""; or as I like to call it: stealing or forcing a tip for walking their skinny-jean clad butts  5 feet to the kitchen to get your to go order that they did not cook. You can also expect a healthy dose of entitled adolescent attitude paired with an owner who does not take lying or stealing from their customers seriously as they make excuses for their staff.

cuI4nkcx6d1bdG--ZM4oww,In general, the food taste good. I like the red lentil soup. But the Iskender is not as authentic as it should be. The syrup made the bottom part of the dessert Baklava soft and not crisp enough. I assume it is because they made a lot and put them there, but the dishes are not gone fast. The service is extremely slow. And there were flies inside the restaurant, and it is very annoying when they fly around.,2013-07-23,_trrlFsD5V1uDrmxLsFPTg,

cXy1NKi1cdsidlaT6dDFKw,Well this used to be one of our favorite place do hookah. Until tonight...if your menu says $25 for hookah plus a drink...then honer those prices. A total bait and switch when we got our $90 bill. No where on the menu does it say $15 per person. On top of it all...we were charged for someone who wasn't smoking at all!!!,2013-08-02,z-PATG1xj-gwS0wmTcjb0Q,
cXy1NKi1cdsidlaT6dDFKw,The server cannot serve alcohol because she's under aged.  Menu prices are not honored.  $25 on the menu  does not equate the $40 we paid for the hookah.

akjewrvAc_LwLqbZ-kqQ5Q,Cafe 1845 just put up new paper menu and pricing signs. Beware because these signs are not correct! The sign at the sandwich area clearly states that you may also get a small bowl of soup included with your sandwich. Even though they are aware of it, the cashiers will charge you for it, and give you attitude when you question it. I had to get the manager involved, and he was polite about it and allowed me to get my soup. If the signs are wrong, they need to be removed.,2015-02-05,LtfKNOi0JkFneOm1KiPWOw,

My experience is they tried to charge me $1000 to come out the same day or $295 to come out the next day because I'm in San Tan Valley. The $295 charge is $100 more than they show on their website, and their website shows $25 off, and it's Memorial Day.

8pSKJ_qRUotjFl_bjH_GQA,The food is decent bar food, but nothing to write home about. Deep fried pickles are pretty tasty. I have been there five times over the past two years. I was a tad unimpressed with beer selection. Their IPA ""Seven"" is average. The most consistent accommodation I received over the 5 times was the slow service. Plan on waiting awhile to order anything. I am not sure if they need more people or what. Service is part of the equation for a successful restaurant to be prosperous.

Selection was decent but food tasted very generic. I. From NY and honestly you would not be able to tell a difference from an average grade Chinese buffet. Maybe I was hoping for more since the only restaurants labeled seafood buffets are wayyyy more higher end buffets.,2013-10-23,rZvis9Acm6-L7jDBctGRPA,

TTDMJetAQKfxVzKZy4Z_2Q,If you enjoy long flight delays, planes with mechanical issues, and terrible customer service standards, Allegiant is just the airline for you. On both ends of my recent trip, I was deboarded because the plane had mechanical issues and we had to wait while another plane was brought in from another airport. They did not keep us on the loop, kept making false promises, made no compensation effort, made no apologies, and barely kept us updated on the rescheduled flight. Freak show.,2013-07-22,MMJUBitrZLg5OwaT0DunhQ,
TTDMJetAQKfxVzKZy4Z_2Q,Without a doubt the worst experience ever on a low cost carrier. The late flight no big deal but the new $50 policy was so over the top agents yelled this over and over it was like we were the enemy not the customer. At one point I questioned how late the flight was going to be and agent teied since everyone has a issue with late flight I will make sure to weigh and double weigh luggage for $50 fee. Luggage overweight another $50 over weight limit 40lbs really all airlines are at 60 lbs $100,2013-09-15,bHE6tKcLbIK6pKO1BJww8A,

Bring snacks.,2017-03-06,C8kAxKm5WG6JQPjSyC4jcA,
TTDMJetAQKfxVzKZy4Z_2Q,The causes for Allegiant delays rarely have to do with weather. Every flight delay I have encountered had to do with 'plane malfunctions'  How scary is that? Why aren't your planes capable and ready at least MOST of the time? The fees add up so quickly that they aren't even that ""cheap""  to fly with  Customer service is awful. Tried to get help with a voucher and there is nothing they can do apparently. They are great at taking your money and not delivering. Hard pass!!,2017-03-13,DOeKvNvhN-WPQcRf5DOfzA,

He tells me he will pick it up at my home and never shows on three different days he agreed to. He ignored my text and phone messages.

-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,For most courses, all options are equally good depending on your own ingredient preferences, but soba salad is far superior to tofu salad; oyster was far more interesting than snow crab; don't pay $2.50 extra for the teriyaki beef because quality is not worth it; tempura is largest portion of fried course; sukiyaki far superior to diced (dry) steak; and corn & egg soup was much better than miso.,2016-01-03,_QqastpJJmlxEScLaI4Mow,

Then our AC went out and they argued with us about it, saying it was fine. Finally it was ""replaced"" a month later, and it still doesn't work well. We have a flasher that targets children, thieves and management doesn't care.  The grounds are terrible and they have told us for 9-months that they are working on it.

8OQReNtWRuBQcFTP8TZgNw,Preparing for a move can be a daunting task. I advise my potential customers to first sell or donate items they do not want to move. Second, plan and prepare early on by selecting things that can be packed that you won't need until after you are in your new home. Use quality boxes and pack heavy items in smaller boxes. Tape and label every box clearly. Stack boxes neatly out of walking paths. To save time and money disassemble and label parts of any thing that needs to taken part for your move.,2015-10-22,NIJFn-wjLHjVSnEm9S4eaw,
