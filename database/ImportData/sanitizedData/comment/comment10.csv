fdkJsDiy27e4Ragp27MMhg,When you pull up the app, it clearly states surge pricing prior to requesting\/committing to a ride. To break it down: 1.1 is a 10% increase, 1.2 is 20%, 2.0 is 100%\/double cost and so forth. I would only split a ride with friends or do short rides during a surge or wait a few min. for the surge to end.,2015-11-01,7p1FfxnjZAuNydjLKEW_Yg

OqzJZWtWgqBgNDIyT1v1eA,Attn mgmt: Proper etiquette is calling a tenant or knocking on the tenant's door before setting up a ladder less than 3 inches from a tenant's car.  Come on guys..you never should set up a ladder near a tenant's car.  It is ""common sense"".  Luckily, I heard the guy setting up the ladder and moved my car because if something had dropped on my car or the ladder had scraped it, you guys would be looking at a lawsuit which could have been avoided by notifying me so I could move my car!,2017-08-23,3_rc8afGuL-rokhks0lcqA

I returned the next week and mentioned last week I was missing items the week before and told (by the same rude employee) ieverything is there.

The woman ran into the first hole to rudely reprimand husband for him not having clubs. We were so shocked and imbarrised by her approach that we decided to leave.

f1KNYRXm8fxIjb6rVdyk7Q,They have a few different salad dressings...if you like blue cheese, theirs is home made. There is also a vinegarette that is good but is a little on the thicker side with a very garlic type taste. Its definitely not your typical balsamic dressing!,2014-08-01,0mWRAT95QOSkc_PqKTURbg

hHtOsr-NMviBKlMqDBeI9Q,In regards to actually finding this place as the directions don't really do justice....you will see ""The Perch"" Restaurant, you have to walk through there, past the birds and nature and Yoli's is in the back to the left.

4hwe5w3opbrwFzezR6i7ig,Hit or miss depending on who's working. Avoid this location if you have CJ's gift cards, 90% of the time they don't know how to redeem them.,2012-10-05,KMXeu9MVXOkb7wEAaU4JEQ
lIFjn05i1kYq4q5cDKURBw,Seriously watch the drive-thru. Sadly they mess up often, and if you request sauce, they now only give you two regardless of how much food you purchase.,2013-04-24,KMXeu9MVXOkb7wEAaU4JEQ
lIFjn05i1kYq4q5cDKURBw,This place has insect problems. 4 times loser with Maricopa County due to a live roach infestation. I found this out after my son noticed them inside the drainage tray on the soda fountain. Awful restaurant.,2014-07-24,KMXeu9MVXOkb7wEAaU4JEQ
UEvT2XH9RVFaZQqmw_f4xQ,On Monday, trash cans in front of the tower elevators were left overflowing, literally trash flowing onto the floor.

QnCsCbE7EQte_MDWLO1gYg,Least favorite Chipotle location. Habitually out of crunchy taco shells once it hits about 7:45pm. I'm not talking right at closing time. And no, they will not fry some up to cover until closing. Mind you it only takes about 10 minutes for EVERY other Chipotle to fry up a batch of shells. They prefer losing my business to the location in Chandler. Very odd.,2017-07-12,KMXeu9MVXOkb7wEAaU4JEQ

Make sure to order extra napkins and don't touch your clothes while eating it, the grease got all over my shorts and was tough to get out. Super-freindly waitress.,2014-07-20,xrvwu2XlBi_fbHAs_n3fkg

FODDWft4nm2cGKeoWzzsvg,Very racist towards Latinos. The GM and sales people won't even look at you when you are approaching, let alone negotiate. I felt very out of place, went there on November 23, 2014, Sunday and the Gm (drives black BMW) did not even give me the time of day, was condescending, rude and walked away from me as soon as I tried to negotiate with him, prepended to be on the phone, b.s. service.

7ZhRvAKdspYG2x_sX0jFog,In accordance with Laurie, I am interested to see what license this company operates under. I own a garage door and gate company, and the jobs they show in their pictures would cost upward of $10,000, which far exceeds the $1,000 handyman exemption.  If you have any questions what licensure means for the consumer, feel free to give me a call, 480 489 5799. I will be waiting eagerly to see what response this company gives.,2015-06-11,JcYcX0gqeZEbvseD_qITKg
7ZhRvAKdspYG2x_sX0jFog,ou call them an honest company, but they operate as a licensed company, when they aren't, and they have nothing in place to protect the consumer.,2016-06-03,JcYcX0gqeZEbvseD_qITKg
7ZhRvAKdspYG2x_sX0jFog,Rite-Away appears to install RV Gates and openers, from the pictures that they have plastered all over their Yelp page. Not a single one of these jobs starts under $1,000, and many go up as high as $20,000.  The issue with an unlicensed company installing RV Gates like this, is that they don't have the ability to be insured or bonded; the ROC laws are in place to protect the customer.,2016-06-03,JcYcX0gqeZEbvseD_qITKg
7ZhRvAKdspYG2x_sX0jFog,hat aside, this company is already listed on yelp, with decent ratings, and the owner has claimed this listing and added photos.  So it should be taken down.,2016-06-22,JcYcX0gqeZEbvseD_qITKg
7ZhRvAKdspYG2x_sX0jFog,I too am interested in what license Rite-A-Way operates under, because from pictures I've seen, they install some large automated gates, that could be a safety hazard if not installed properly. There is a handyman exemption, allowing unlicensed contractor's to do jobs up to $1000, but RV Gates start well over that amount.,2015-06-30,JcYcX0gqeZEbvseD_qITKg

3akSOcI-uzHOwGQeZD3NHg,I'm a bit confused why you have offers on Yelp yet you don't honor them in the restaurant...was going to make a pizza order and figured 50% off cheese sticks if I ""check-in"", why not? When I called to place the order I was told the business does nothing through Yelp. Maybe just update your page? All I can think about is mozzarella sticks now.,2017-09-08,lS9dj5KjM8lHETL6UA4idQ

So I went back up to the entrance and asked ""aren't they supposed to wipe down the inside?"" He said oh not with the basic, I told him I got the VIP. So he called Fernando on the talkie and I pulled up by detail. Fernando starts to blow the interior with air.He said ""better?"" I said no, don't you wipe down the interior? He said we just dust it!!

We had to take our pizza to go and cancel the rest of our order because of the seating situation.,2013-02-21,LDyNMZ4ozm7wDdOgM2XgqA

We are still here waiting for them to get it done 10 mins later.  Only one person ahead of us.  They made fun of my husband for saying he wanted the meat cut normally for sandwiches.

Staff not caring about patients, all patients being feed the same meals even if placed on special diets from Drs, staff not knowing their patients ie when they are sick or even knowing they are sick not reporting it to the In house dr for evaluation and treatment. If you have to put a loved on in a home I would do my research and definitely bypass this facility!

-oSII3bw90cvyLmgsHgmpg,My tips to the owners of this establishment- Marinate your meat. Use proper rice for the spam musubi. Lower your price to $1.50 - $2.00 for the spam musubi or put an extra piece in if you're going to keep the price at $3.00. Fry the spam, don't just slice it. Perfect your macorni salad recipe.,2015-10-12,aVzsQ7Iu7KbwOdMJGwXU7g

VxgjMl8tQrT4idJW_z8daA,This is our first time here but we will be back. The waiter Cory was so personable and on the ball. Then there was the food. I have eaten all of these things before but they never tasted like this. The seasoning was awesome on all of the food but the wood burning flavor to the steak was to die for. Now the one thing I have to say that is disparaging is that they don't know what well done is but I took the first bite and then finished the redest steak I have ever eaten and loved it.,2014-04-28,rwzjllAcdmWJdKgFISFVZw

Try to call there and ask questions you never talk to a live person you end up leaving Voice message no one returns call and after you go thru hoops to talk to a live Rep they do not offer solution but plenty obstacles.

5VXsbrqyJx0a4iaa43RNFA,I ordered Chilaquiles.  $8.50 - the menu is very vague, I recommend asking what their version of a specific dish is because I was fairly disappointed.  I received a platter of chips, cheese , salsa n an egg prepared over easy.  Looked like a platter of nachos.  They had missed one ingredient...chicken.  They apologized and asked if they could just give me a side of chicken. Then they gave me 20% off of my bill...not sure how I feel about that.  Anyway...just ask questions before you order!,2013-08-11,RAK7ORGqGVrbHZhx-3xyeQ

BFZZ8Fw14nxgS3p6bP5jag,Bad experience. Originally agreed on 3 movers, 2 showed up. One of our new leather sofas was somehow damaged during the move as well. I tried bringing this up to JP the next day and he got VERY confrontational with me over the phone, completely switched from the nice guy who took my $660 the day before for the move. Hmm. Interesting. I'm a very ethical person, didn't appreciate how he was talking to me or things that he was implying. Will never use them again learn from my mistake.,2013-07-13,rM53cdFIvcmakcPl5Ei4kQ
