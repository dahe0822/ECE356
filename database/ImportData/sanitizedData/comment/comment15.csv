GJgn_HrEPYz0qDKmyVQqfg,DO NOT use this doctor.  Vegas is too full of eye doctors to put up with this one. It's all about the DOLLAR, period. I contacted my insurance company after I left to verify what I already knew  (that my deductible had been met), and sure enough, they didn't bother checking. I sat there and waited while filling out paperwork, only to have them refuse to see me until I paid them 250 dollars up front.

OawTcIafwcfa2gzBzf1Rbg,Ken is lauded in these reviews, but has less than zero customer service skills when it comes down to saying more than the price points for what he already has in stock. If you give your number expecting feedback or an ETA on what you want, expect to be absolutely forgotten -- even if you're proactive and check in with him. Absolutely embarrassing attempt at meeting even HIS OWN barebones promises. STAY AWAY!,2017-10-05,9wCf_htfipOl80iljteukg,

X6UI4rkQLhzQXk492V_GAw,During the blazing Summer months, the best time to go becomes Friday night. It opens at 4pm but most get there around 6pm if they want to shop. Though the number of vendors on Friday night is lower than Sat\/Sun the leased vendors all come out and their selection will be better than Sat\/Sun since it is the first sales day of the week. Also, many more trickle in throughout the night due to the concerts going on via the stage. Because of sunset, the weather is a lot cooler too.,2015-08-22,xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,
X6UI4rkQLhzQXk492V_GAw,Walk around if you find something you like but is fairly common.

X6UI4rkQLhzQXk492V_GAw,Try checking out the place on Friday night. You want to arrive by 6pm if you are there to shop.

OhYtdNmsWxSgBuD462PkIA,My best tip for this monastery page would be for those considering writing a review strictly about the monthly food fair that you add your review to the dedicated Food Fair business page here on Yelp.

YIYE7Zk61McLaekLFluzTg,Many of the tips and reviews specify certain specific food items that they suggest and adore. My tip is to not get your hopes up over tasting one or two specific food items that you read about on here. The voluntary vendors change and they may bring different items next month. Though there are some staples like Pad Thai, some of the other speciality items may or may not be there when you go. One thing you can count on though: most of the food will be extraordinary. Enjoy!,2015-09-27,xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,

Then, we drove around and wait well over the 10 minutes for the food. As we are leaving, they began locking the doors. KFC doesn't usually close at this time.  So I called them at 9:55 and told them about the mistake. I was told that I recieved the correct sandwich and there was nothing they could do.

ko1v9-BdTqZQWmx4DIHWaw,As a vegas local, this place is extremely depressing and I like to avoid at all cost. With the money the hotel and casino are making you would imagine the dolphin tank to be at least the size of the humans pool next door? Maybe a sun covering or protective plants? The lions are normally sleeping because hello! We're in vegas 100+ weather. I can't stand animal captivity, especially poor captivity in a very lavish and well off city.

nQD284VfImPe_UXkmq4yaQ,As a vegas local, I know the area that this hotel is located (extreme street life) and the parking actually scares me. Park your vehicles in view of your room! Keep an eye on it and do not leave items in your vehicle (even iPod cords will get a car broken into). Don't blame it on the hotel blame it on VEGAS. Wake up people,2015-03-11,CmOjOZEbEceR-GgOPKld1w,

RPjBB_uhHQ4oxp39Jqm_HQ,I love Capriottis. This location however has been a constant disappointment. It is so close to my work and sometimes you just crave a turkey sandwich. I'm always hesitant to go here because either I get the end of the loaf for my sandwich or I find nasty cartilage or bone in my turkey. It really ruins it for me, but I've gotten better to where I look through my sandwich when I order from here to find any nasties before they end up in my mouth!,2015-06-01,ILAQ7WNCiKkp3SIVHX_Zdw,

Fst6_M69Dghjh2iXGHFX-Q,I was having trouble finding a facial I liked.  Diana was amazing and helped me figure out what was best for my skin.  Since I have been going I can tell a huge difference on my skin and also how much better my makeup goes on now.  I had been struggling with acne and since Diana has been giving me facials I havent had any acne in over 6 months!!  I highly recommend her.  She is amazing and sweet on top of being great at what she does!!!,2013-07-17,61Y-IAr5P4z4fRHQfNZJjw,
Fst6_M69Dghjh2iXGHFX-Q,Go to Diana.  She's a great listener and is good at catering to your needs.  My skin has never looked better!!!,2013-08-08,61Y-IAr5P4z4fRHQfNZJjw,
Fst6_M69Dghjh2iXGHFX-Q,CLaudine, Claudine, Claudine! I have been to several places in the las vegas area for skin care, facials, peels etc, but Claudine is by far the best! I had a peel and a facial with her. I came home and my boyfriend was convinced I had plastic surgery or injections. My skin has never looked better. I highly suggest Claudine. She will not try to sell you things you don't want or need. You will not find someone better than her! I'm already booked for my next facial and can't wait.,2013-08-07,2s-j9qjA4WK0T2wKhfHj7w,

Fst6_M69Dghjh2iXGHFX-Q,Claudine is probably the best aesthetician who has ever worked on my skin.   She knows what she's doing!  And she listens to what your problems are, helps you diagnose what needs to be done, makes suggestions, and then you end up walking out looking fabulous.  And her oxygen treatment makes your face feel phenomenal.  Don't wait, run and ask for Claudine because she will make you smile!,2014-04-19,CCsvmcN8U1pSxs58DUx8Bg,

Fst6_M69Dghjh2iXGHFX-Q,I never gave much thought to getting facials. Then came groupon and I bounced all over town for cheap facials. I figured something was better than nothing. I had one for skinbar where I met Claudine. She is AMAZING very knowledgeable and so sweet! I now drive from summerlin every month even without the groupon price. They do have a loyalty card which helps :) I am so pleased with how great my skin looks. I always get complements and wear less makeup.
