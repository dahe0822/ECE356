Plenty of other tables near the window and in general area of normal dining room. Food Chkn Alfo got cold quick. Still tipped 20% but pissed off because I usually tip well and like to dine on strip.

Awful, nothing like a crappy staff, serving food you didn't order.  Stay away, if you want to get a better meal, go to Taco Bell, that's how bad this place is!

TbHiV1t65v_Tyr0_ro1tbg,Worst service ever. Arrived at 8:15pm on a Saturday night with 20 people. ( we called ahead and they knew we were coming) seated us promptly. Took our drink orders. Then didn't see our server for almost an hour. After they finally took our order , they were missing two or three orders. . The manager was no where to be found. He made two 5 minute appearances which did not resolve any of the problems. Bottom line, goto a different Montana's.

I strongly did't feel it was worth the $ Tickets were very pricey.  I don't recommend to kids less 10.

VyVIneSU7XAWgMBllI6LnQ,The brisket is really good and brittle, probably better off getting a brisket sand which. The 3 meat platter is really good, gives you an idea of what you will most likely get the second time around. And after trying between the sausage, brisket and ribs, ribs definitely take the cake! Corn bread is also good as an appetizer, and the grilled veggies really had some good flavor as we'll. The sauces are really good to I suggest the spicy, and at the end we got mini sugar donuts! Yum!,2014-08-01,0qKXsEJHiY36BgtKS4I_IQ,

Additionally, we always have to ask for forks and knives.  It's as though we are expected to eat with our fingers.  The place has potential but management seems persistent in making sure this place fails.  It's sad!,2013-09-15,YV005mGNPaTciBry-Qu9og,

Z9XF1y4VNFkRlGSlnoy0Zw,Just lefr this store... stood in the middle of the store for 15 minutes for someone to help me. No luck,  it seems as if the incoming phone calls were more important than customers in the store waiting. I stood there while an available associate was walking around, and as soon as the phone rang ""Jordan"" quickly assisted them before people in the store. So I figured the only way to get help was to call. So I did from outside the store and got the ""help"" that I didn't receive in the store. Sad!!,2013-08-26,UPw5DWs_b-e2JRBS-t37Ag,

ApAzthiFRKuL-yJo1HMFvQ,My wife and I go here for trivia almost every Thursday night. We love it when we go here. During law school Dilworth was always the place for events. They had great deals for group events. I must say that I am particularly taken by the $3 bartenders choice special. But that is just because I like to live dangerously. I must say thought that I miss Brian as a bartender.,2013-04-23,3Xq7ucmNZfHHecpLjOF6LQ,

ApAzthiFRKuL-yJo1HMFvQ,This is not an establishment I would recommend if you are trying to have a get together with friends. We tried booking a party in advanced and were never called nor would the manager take our calls. She made it clear that she did not want our business.

O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,Be a good customer, follow their lead in a dance If you occupy a seat around the rail tip some on every dancer regardless of your interest. That's PER SEAT not per group. The girls are friends and word travels fast. Shitty customers drive the atmosphere down for everyone. If your not interested say No. Your not hurting anyone's feelings. If you engage in a conversation she's expecting at least a tip (no matter what is said). Follow these tips and you will enjoy yourself. Oh and be clean!!!,2016-03-10,qudS2jg2hkd60GbN6Wxl5w,

Please do not bring fast food to feed you children. It creates a burden for the owneowners\/waiter\/waitress to clean more than they should. I hate to see Ben Thanh losing business due to people that dont respect the restaurant.

iXH73faCXa6UdLAKMe-vGQ,HT is one of my faves, however this specific location is worst by far. Every.single.time. It's a joke; an oft-spoken topic this location is insanely slow at service (not server fault; it's the kitchen). It doesn't matter what time of day; your food will take at least 30 min, most times much longer.  However, Mooresville, Asheville, Huntersville HT's are awesome, both in speed and service. This restaurant is clearly run by someone different than other close locations. Not near as clean either.,2016-11-27,tNt5UvYAqO6vJfEiw2WMEQ,

x7n2MzAx3ncAQtE4bIjT3A,Management lacks in the communication dept. Notices do not get delivered to those that work late, KEEP a copy of your necessary repairs when you sign your lease, DON'T believe what office staff tell you, since  management can't seem to warn them about not falsifying information to residents, nor takes an interest in correcting it. Overall, the apt price is great, but don't move in until all of your demands are met, and ALWAYS ask to speak to higher level management to get the proper information.,2013-04-26,tL5RsHx0r6axFHKgbB4kwA,

e5jpQUyVHaJohPUgZVsWKw,Get everything in writing. Management can be shady. Take pictures at move-in and at move-out. They use very low quality carpeting so it's futile trying to keep it clean. Accept a cleaning or carpet replacement charge upfront. When we lived there, a lot of residents' dogs had tick infestations.

When we walked in, we were told our table wouldn't be ready for another 20 minutes or so past our reservation. We had amazing service! The bartender was very attentive and quick to have drinks while we waited. Dinner was SPECTACULAR! I recommend the fried zucchini and the calamari, lots of flavor and tasty!

I don't know how they're able to make it so perfect, the pastry was delicious, texture was just right. It's served medium rare, which I don't prefer, but turned out really well.

Crab legs where pretty dry,  the pasta section doesn't even call your name..steak and mashed potatoes where good. I had guacamole with chips which where ok as well. The only good thing about the dessert section is the bread pudding and the yogurt machine.  I guess I was expecting more out of this place since it's in the mirage. I  will just stick to my cheaper buffets which offer the same thing anyways.,2016-07-31,YpBpSDw8JxZaZumsRXtg2Q,

7tNY4BYLA4laqWNV4IWGQg,We found this place through a ""Best Pizza across America"" on Google. It smells delicious the moment you walk in. The pizza is wood fired & very traditional Italian in flavour. We had the Diavalo & were pleasantly surprised by the level of spiciness. The Antipasto platter wasn't quite what we were anticipating, but it was refreshingly different & authentic. We didn't have room for desert, but next time we'll know what's coming & save room - very excited to try HouseMade Tiramisu & Gelato!,2013-11-06,2mXmWx-iSYdYEpm9oMB8CA,

Everything seems to take forever. The food is delicious. We've had the chicken caesar salad, t-bone (the fillet part wasn't even there which was very disappointing), prime rib dip, and my favorite cajun ribeye . I spoke to the manager that was on duty about the wait time\/svs but he just nodded and had no explanation :-\/.,2015-09-07,3r_d241hLYErdsnmkY382w,

y3RlbCN0UrDdLnjSF9NkXA,Great home made style Mexican food.  Mexican comfort food.  My family and I have eaten there for 17 years!  I KNOW Mexican food having lived for years near the border and worked from time to time in Mexico.  With the exception of their use of American made rather than authentic Mexican made cheeses (which many Americans wouldn't like), this is the real thing.

""Because only the owner can make them & he isn't here"" so we were forced to order by the slice. Then to make matters worse I watched the young woman behind the counter touch her hair & then a piece of pizza. The icing on the cake?

PL_kv7YO7ZwbDAm9R_ronQ,Really a waste of money. I did Vegas night, the helicopter tour. The staffs are nice and they served drink before flying. The captain is nice and friendly. However, I was really disappointed because I was seated in the back on the right and I saw only the houses, NOT the strips views as advertised. The helicopter flew like a circle, so people who sit in the front and the back only left side saw the strip view.

Hey act likes it's impossible and it's they have to get permission from Eat24 to change their menu (so there is zero user interface from the restaurant on these sites? Really?) I love their pizza and subs. But they are not embracing  the online ordering at all. Don't tell people to just call you instead.

The cashier didn't tell me how much the total order was when I was done ordering, didn't ask if I wanted a drink, etc. I know this is a fast food place but come on.
