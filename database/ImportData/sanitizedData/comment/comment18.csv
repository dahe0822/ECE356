Then when she made my 3 drinks she grabbed the cup stuck her hand that she didn't wash in the ice bin and contaminated the ice. I've been a bartender for 9 years handling food and drinks and know I would be fired on the spot if I did that.  I will never eat at hot dog on a stick and will post this on all social media.

Don't get trapped by their offer of a taste. You can see the scheme steaming from their eyes, but my kids had already been reeled in so it was too late.  $30 for 4 tiny bowls of not very good stuff.

Creme brûlée is a home run. Bread pudding needs some creme anglais to make it a swooning dessert. I wish these two could've been served warm though.

They served her soup that contained shell fish right off the bat. The cook contaminated all the food with lobster. He put lobster on our plates that we didn't order. We payed our bill and didn't eat.

They had my car all day and FORGOT to do one of the windows that I paid for.  The owner said he would have someone come to my work to finish the tinting job.  I called twice a week for the next two months to schedule it but they could never find the time.  They never called me back after two months if calling.  After 9 weeks of calling I finally got the owner Jason on the phone and nothing!!!,2013-10-19,TeEt3ck4ZZlzwKglH21Nzw,

Emily was very nice and attentive but what caught our attention was the fact that Alam Leyva made it a point to come talk to us and get a feel for his customers. Not many managers do that and I think that other managers need to take notes from Alam and chat up the customers more often, get to know the people who patronize your business. Thank you Alam.,2016-05-27,eaRNhdVlwAEgW-DXi1XUkg,

vFWYJFEEp-HeO7bsJOyEZA,This place is absolutely horrible. The service is terrible; they treat you as though you are inconveniencing them. No one abides by the specials they promote, probably because half of the staff aren't aware of the specials to begin with. The food? Disgusting. Order the Smore's dessert, and you will wait thirty minutes for a marshmallow covered scoop of ice cream. Management does not apologize for anything.

TgcjQfl1E9DE-SjDVOUDJQ,The Peanut Butter Milkshake is an absolute must. It is practically pure peanut butter and the straw is useless. So good ($7).,2014-09-04,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
1BrIPwRhJHOp6yBwjoRtgg,Big selection of fun flavors. Try the Fat Elvis and the Turtle Cheesecake.,2015-01-11,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g,Crazy long waits for decent burgers and shakes and really inattentive service. Try the Farm Burger ($15), which sounds reasonably priced, until you realize it doesn't come with fries ($11 for Truffle Parmesan Fries).,2015-01-11,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,Excellent Asian\/American food hidden in a semi-depressing casino. That Short Rib Grilled Cheese is incredible ($10).,2015-01-10,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,

qdV0dLjJ2duhNoYlhVavzw,Pretty good place trying hard to look like the Sprinkles of the doughnut world. The Carrot Cake is good, but the base of the yeast doughnuts is just ok.,2014-09-04,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
_l3nxDFpmLUMxCQrz1LfBQ,Some of the best coffee in town, but also a really amazing Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookie.,2014-09-08,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
bhqOSajw2x1NLQxijsDVcg,The menu sounds like heaven if you like garbage and fried food, but it's unfortunately not very well-executed. The Kentucky Fried Handshake Sandwich provides a great photo op, but just is not very good to eat ($13).,2014-09-07,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
bhqOSajw2x1NLQxijsDVcg,This place is worth coming to for dessert alone, especially for the incredible soft serve from the Sweet Jesus pop-up. The Chocolate Peanut Butter EpiPen is incredible ($6).,2014-09-07,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
D5oYTE-sbkV2wurOWOGzjQ,Shockingly sweet doughnuts. They just slap different icings somewhat lazily onto the same yeast base. I would hit Glory Hole instead.,2014-09-08,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,

DlFKsdGY7-7c4u7_A-W99Q,The fake Cronut here was among one of the stalest pastries I've ever eaten. More support for why people wait on line for the real one. Skip this ($3.25).,2014-09-07,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
uAAWlLdsoUf872F1FKiX1A,This is one of those places with so many incredible choices that it's frustrating trying to decide. An ice cream sandwich is a must, but even then there are too many great cookie and ice cream flavors to choose from. But go with the PB&J ice cream of course.,2014-09-04,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,

N0l4hT7UCywbZ9UEZ1R9kQ,Great food on the small brunch menu. The Quinoa Breakfast Fried Rice ($11) is awesome, as is the Loco Moco special.,2014-09-04,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
6cIhp2atp7LSMR5ke9DOHg,Beautiful restaurant owned by Ivan Reitman and a fun time for movie fans, especially Ghostbusters, as there are Stay Puft Marshmallow Men all over the place. Also, the food happens to be quite good too.,2014-09-07,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
6cIhp2atp7LSMR5ke9DOHg,The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man Baked Alaska is tasty, but more of a novelty dessert ($12). Get the Chocolate Chip Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich if you just want the better-tasting choice ($10).,2014-09-07,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
PbyqDJf815zRn-7p6vYpAQ,Get one of the excellent Cool Haus Ice Cream Sandwiches. The IM-Pei-Nut Butter is amazing ($7).,2015-01-10,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,

biSsdqExmdvIKiFuowOadg,Pretty bad food. Some of the Crispy Rice Tuna was completely burnt, the Cheese Mazemen was like glue, and the Foo Foo Platter was flavorless beige. But the Chicken Fried Rice was very good ($8) and service was very nice!,2015-01-12,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,So many choices for some great, heavy southern food. The Fried Chicken is a must ($36 with the great waffles) and make sure you also get the Mac & Cheese ($10).,2015-01-12,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
QJatAcxYgK1Zp9BRZMAx7g,Great location specific concretes here. Get the All Shook Up, which has banana peanut butter cheesecake and chocolate toffee ($4.50).,2015-01-10,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,
0qet57CmMA5qUm6gPFUTpg,The only thing in common with the original Brooklyn location is the name. This is mediocre food court pizza ($8 a slice).,2014-12-29,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q,

KSkjE3krqsovBs7iC4x7ng,I live very close to this Denny's so it's ashame.  I usually never make it past the podium.  No exaggeration here.   You will stand there for a long long long time.  They have no clue on staffing.  Once you get in there is a great late night waiter but he's the only one working.  Everyone else is just  not happy to be there and showing it.  Getting a bill is a challenge.  Listen there is a 24 hour IHOP on trop just down the street before pecos.  Night and day service.  Go there.,2014-02-15,mbQMcc6yVSevA24WM0T_Hw,

hcLsY_jZZbqoFngUSraVVA,Wi-fi does not work here. Router was unplugged and plugged back in, still doesn't work. Apparently this has been the case for at least *4 months*?! A cafe should have wi-fi.,2014-11-20,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
KYZZhLg1e5I5M4XuVMv2sg,Surprisingly clean and because of its unpopularity (on Yelp at least) there were a ton of sizes avail on clearance racks. 11 pieces of clothing for $47. (Almost as cheap as chicken!),2013-09-17,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,Captions on photos are helpful at a place like this...,2013-02-12,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
FevycwulBfHEZt77dv2EyA,BOO! Their $2.99 'secret' breakfast special is now actually a $2.99 portion (super small!) so by the time you order 2 of 'em, you might as well go anywhere. Do they think we wouldn't notice? ;),2013-03-14,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
FevycwulBfHEZt77dv2EyA,Massive Alert! NO MORE $2.99 breakfast special.,2013-04-20,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,

_3FxLxdg1unUQc3QqIgJuA,Do *NOT* fall for the Lobster Chowder. Looks great on the menu, but comes out thin, salty, and missing actual edible lobster. The only piece of ""lobster"" in it was the cartilaginous tip of the claw - a sucker piece - doesn't count. Hubert Keller's Fleur tried pulling the same claw-tip lobster bullshit in his lobster mac & cheese.,2014-07-31,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
2UgRg5a6KmpbD_SZfhNrKg,Evan Williams is the bourbon on the rail here - wayyyy tastier than Jim Beam! (You can buy 750ml of EW at Total Wine for $8.99 but oh well!),2013-01-23,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
d1pB6SLzLb-4lFq8y5tEnQ,Come HERE for their one-of-a-kind Soon Tofu (or go across the street to Tofu Hut where the Pho Kim Long type go...),2012-12-19,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
d1pB6SLzLb-4lFq8y5tEnQ,Alert: the ""pepper powder"" aka the signature ingredient in Mr. Tofu's soon tofu, has CHANGED! It has lost it's lovin' feelin', unfortunately. Tastes completely different (bland like everybody else's) - say it ain't so!,2013-04-23,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
Mh84_j7YmRrAcm0DWV4bUw,Wow. Got the Italian sub (no. 1 with mortadella) to go and I couldn't resist eating the entire thing before leaving the store.,2015-09-03,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
PLVJCN2p1MIkeDzIbAx9kA,Finally! A breakfast restaurant that doesn't refill their ketchup bottles! The Heinz (and Yang) Families would approve. Down with botulism!,2013-03-14,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,

zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,LDTV (low definition televisions) actually worse than standard TV reception, if that's possible. Not the best place to watch sports. Grub 'n' go!,2014-08-20,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
zEaGcSVPDQipnRdEZp-F6g,Surprise! (and BEWARE) Order 2 toppings on one half of your pizza and another 2 toppings on the other half and you may be charged for 4 toppings. Pretty sneaky, Dom!,2013-01-31,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
zdUT6mXCSkyWFm8I4ARkdw,Opens at 4:30am. Continental breakfast spread includes bagels, granola, yogurt and Maker's Mark if you are so inclined ;),2013-02-07,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,

78hGCrQ6wLA2yh8zMywnmw,Don't tell everyone, but this is an incredible place to watch the game! An open air bar, an abundance of big HDTVs, laid back staff, all-day $1.95 Pacifico pints, a classic a la carte Mexican menu, and a convincing SoCal sunset feel can't be beat.,2013-03-31,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
sZsJooAzpKqOvDysphkqpQ,Getting individual slices heated up here is a better bet than ordering an entire pie. It's just the nature of their crust. Similar to West Las Vegas's Those Guys Pies with respect to being better reheated than fresh. No biggie - very typical of authentic NY style pizza. ;),2015-09-13,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
bTozn7_pTXY-IIGRXwiXIw,Business is closed for good (90% sure?),2014-05-11,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
Xj7DIGRHEchJ-VVdISazQQ,Absolute worst part of the Javier's experience is the super cheesy and annoying bathroom attendants. Get 'em outta there. A waste of everyone's time - when you have to rinse off your salsa hands before you pee and then wash up again, I don't want you squirting a shit ton of cheap scented soap on my hands twice.,2014-11-20,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA,A little smoky BUT a great place to watch sports! (and eat Fat Choy),2013-01-19,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,Cool, breezy patio in the wind wash behind the Ogden! But be wary of the Raku-style beer menu  - no prices listed and about half of the beers aren't available.,2013-03-31,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,First impression (March 31): there seems to be a disconnect between the menu designers and what is available\/being served. Chicken Bar Bites come out not how you would expect (super-skimpy portion in a 'fancy' faux-cast-iron skillet) and the craft beers show up at your table in... a can.,2013-03-31,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
FpLv8vFi-83wqvQqWtKKJw,If smooth jazz annoys you, beware 'cause that's all they play here. :),2015-02-24,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
MX2OYa2sS5ys_6AiK-gs3A,A sign on their drink cooler says $15 credit card minimum, but when I tried using a card the lady said they use Square and her ""phone is completely cracked"" - whatever *that* means. Cash it is then?,2014-04-12,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,Pizza Rock is NOT honoring their 15% check-in offer. The bartender said they've ""sent Yelp numerous emails about it"" but that makes absolutely no sense because check-in offers are controlled instantly from the business account webpage. You don't have to lie about it, sheesh!,2016-01-02,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
ym5FOqL6tGbgynzwKMHZuw,Having more than 3 crabs for yourself? Order only 3 to start, otherwise crabs #4, 5 and 6 will get cold ;),2014-02-04,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
igHYkXZMLAc9UdV5VnR_AA,$1.99 steak (2 oz.) and egg during happy hour (3-6pm everyday) is great, BUT, order only one first to see what cut of steak they're using today, and to see the grill skills of the chef on duty. Today's was just a sirloin, and it was tough as shit.,2016-06-16,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,

0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,Avoid sitting at the long community ""picnic"" tables in front of the windows - you will feel absolutely every single movement and vibration from your neighbors - a terrible design... form over function. It will drive you nuts!,2015-09-18,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,
A_CXVdyJCE6nyxwbd6fNwg,Their mussels are small, and the mussel meat itself is tiny. Or if you don't believe me you can order a $24 bowl and find out for yourself. (I told you so.),2016-08-18,W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,

4NxIM5xpIEem1IkEkz2I7Q,First time at this place and I'm pleasantly delighted with the service. The food has a home cooked taste to it just like Mom makes (si soy Mexicano, yes I'm Mexican). Chips and salsa are excellent.   I had the carne asada plate with a green sauce chicken enchilada it came with rice and beans. The green sauce was a bit salty, but besides that I can't complain! I will definitely be back especially because if you have ten meals the 11th one is FREE!,2013-07-15,YQGNjAe_6bsBkgfORBet-w,

3QzPhQ3ltbon0-1gC7Q18Q,I hate the fact that the garden is on Main St so it is really noisy and you are just staring at traffic, but I guess it would be a great place to people watch especially downtown where there are sobe characters! The place is cooly decorated. The great thing about the bar is that it is smoke free, but I don't think the outside is (that sucks). They officially open in the beginning of March, so menu options are currently limited. Another great addition to downtown LV!,2014-02-14,YQGNjAe_6bsBkgfORBet-w,

N832DmLicgaZFahNHIj7jQ,Tradewind represents the owners and does not care about the tenants. Example. The owner of my home let my sink stay broke for over a week. It leaked all over the place and everything in the house is about to break. They said they never got any of my three messages for maintenance. Then my wife went into tradewind and filled out a work order and then they claimed they lost it. Then they couldn't reach the owner. In the meanwhile I had no sink. Against hud regulations.

mCQNt7t8akLpS0XuFBbQyA,My son had never been to daycare until he turned 4 years old. It was very intimidating to leave my child with just anyone. I looked at places that are corporate and felt that maybe my child wouldn't get the attention I felt like he needed being that this would be his first time in daycare. Nae Nae's has been wonderful. Lots of attention and a very positive feeling when you leave knowing your child is in good hands. My son loves it!

SAIrNOB4PtDA4gziNCucwg,Best cocktails in town! They were offering a half off steak the night we went in. Food was reasonably priced. We spent a fortune in drinks.

8fYvO8ZMILIlPcYNB9IA1w,I won tickets from komp radio station and was really impressed with the show. We thought it may be cheesy and didn't really have high expectations but it was soo good. The performers did have some resemblance to the actual musicians. The best part was their voices, the dancers and choreography, and the band. I would recommend this show to locals and tourists alike! Something for everybody!:),2013-08-09,-67oCytJCBR4x1atdwn7ug,
OktwRjOI1nCaq5_AJMWWDQ,We went here after our business was turned away from the silverton because my 10 year old daughter was not allowed in despite kids of hotel guests being  present.

Free for locals on friday before noon. Well definitely return!:),2013-08-09,-67oCytJCBR4x1atdwn7ug,

For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would eat at a Taco Bell when they have Pepe's Tacos--for starters,  the ingredients are fresh here, and I KNOW that the meat I'm eating is REAL chicken.

MWyv0delstZwPcBkGzmwbA,Service is terrible.  Went in to watch a preseason football game. Now preseason games don't count, so it wasn't crowded at all. They had a waitress for the floor, and one bartender. I sat down at a side counter, close to the big TV,  waited 10-15 minutes,  and no one came by. I then went up to the bar, and made eye contact with the two servers. NEITHER OF THEM ACKNOWLEDGED ME. Watched the ENTIRE first half without ANYONE asking for my order, then left. No problem--never going back there.,2014-08-22,jvmKUjbMarAMRFoxousQAQ,

66jwLkSd6M0cZulZrA3zcw,Ive been to Applebee's on numerous occassions, but this is my first review.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm giving them an 8.  Why an 8, my steak was a little undercooked.  I asked for my steak cooked medium and when it came to the table it was medium rare.  But, I wasn't freaked out because I'm use to eating medium rare steaks.  Overall the service was stellar, and my steak had a really good flavor.  So an 8 is definitely appropriate.,2014-01-26,FR3yOFal7e5u93WRhML4NQ,

When she did the design she didn't wait for the polish to dry and smeared my design on all of my nails. She did not want to fix them. I will never go here again.,2013-12-06,RcGMEmid0piAuSOZhnSV5g,

Why are you (Managenent) charging me for the services every month but can't seem to get the services. And the water bill of 80.00 a month is not right. Are most places like this here where you get charged separately for water.

eFqkLqHpcvb_y63kfs4ghw,I just read some of these negative reviews and I was offended by it.  First off,  I'm a female.   Secondly,  I've been going to Lee and Jeff since right after they opened because my father found them first. I have referred countless people and businesses over the years, had people thank me for it and I will continue to do so.   Never in my life have I met more honest mechanics that DON'T treat women like morons. If you want honesty and a true commitment to service,  check them out!,2014-05-03,tez7B6Xdq4aCDY5j9YgA_g,
