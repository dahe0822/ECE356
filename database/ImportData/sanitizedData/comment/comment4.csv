3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ,The building is an old converted church so the inside is really awe inspiring. The tacos are a little pricy at $3.95 each but the gourmet flavors are worth it. The chicken is good but a bit bland so it's ""meh"". The lamb and the cherry beefy are outstanding. Although the food lacks much seasoning, it let's the food breathe. chips are warm and fresh and the salsa has a nice little kick. But my favorite dish here is the queso dip. REALLY flavorful. The guacamole needs more seasoning but it's good.,2013-12-07,LZ-dU_13mEQZBHW1AkKOOA
Ak08F6RqjHYmVCzweBbTrQ,Worst experience EVER!  Waited over an hour for cold satay and a salad with fish that was so greasy it was inedible.  $25 later I canceled the dinner order for fear of how long it would take to get and what it would taste like.  Off to Thai Basil we went.  If this experience could receive negative stars, I would give you 5!,2013-03-19,Z74dJ5Ly8a_PJgOG4ftg4A

Ak08F6RqjHYmVCzweBbTrQ,Lunch hour is hopping but staff remains calm and very friendly. The beef panang lunch portion is generous beyond my expectation. Also the level of spice is just perfect without being overpowering hot. You get choice of tom yum gain or egg roll. Both were relish.,2016-11-15,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
HYunM2pknhIh8lbiMa7THw,Alisha is such a doll and so helpful. Was surprised at the limited type of brushes and paint trays avail. Seems geared more to contractors than homeowners or doityourselfers. In any event, great colors to choose from.,2015-04-29,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg,You seriously can't beat their lunch specials from sushi to noodle bowls. I love the Beef Nanban Udon. Pure goodness. The portions are generous and priced beyond a bargain. Love the desserts as this is my weakness. And of course, service is sweet and friendly. If you have a sweeter tooth, go next door to Snoh for shaved ice or boba!,2015-02-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
AISrYnWxgcHOueNE_xNa-A,Such a wonderful spot for conferences or meetings. Easy parking without the fuss especially if it's an early meeting. Great staff. Delish breakfast and lovely setup! Not to mention, the golfing here is pretty awesome too.,2015-11-06,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
p3cBYY8Tov5TOaXV2aY-wA,Plant seeds of happiness and grab these lovelies for only $7 and spread happiness around your office space,2015-05-19,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
p3cBYY8Tov5TOaXV2aY-wA,I can't gush enough about this place. Buy their herbs. They flourish tenfolds even in the containers. Their return\/exchange policy on florals is unmatched. I bought peonies that wilted within 24 hours but they exchanged them with no hassle or trouble. You have my heart and loyalty!,2015-05-20,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
1JpfQCgLnmz6VU00O1XIPw,I adore this little spot. The staff is always so pleasant. They have wonderful coffee but I cannot resist the tea here. Try the hibiscus flower or the caramel almond though the mandarin orange is a melody of calm and peacefulness soothing to the soul.,2015-01-17,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
YIl7bWVL6yHYy4GuDSkyTQ,Seriously $2.50 for all items. You get the impressive service of a high end cleaner without breaking your bank. Staff is always happy and friendly. And if you refer someone they give you credit towards future bill. Amaze balls!!!,2015-05-20,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
0xyqLvtr0Zbr4G-gML-QmQ,Great HH because lasts til 7p given they open at 5p. HH menu is perfect if you're not looking for a heavy meal. The calamari is the right level of spice with the sweetness to tone it down. I loved the Colby Red so much I should have ordered a bottle since I drank that much. The HH burger is ridiculously huge and the filet mignon flatbread is scrumptious. Sit at the bar and have Brandon serve you.,2017-07-31,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
T9g8TZyms7C0OO-mc0LWhA,Any girl knows finding a good salon is like finding a good guy. It's a rarity, you better hang on to it. Prices are affordable and service is stellar! They can get slammed so call ahead. Offers full service from waxes to lashes to your usual mani\/pedi. Impressed by the massaging chairs and cleanliness of spa. Best part, they put on football during weekends or talk shows weekday if you need to zone out. You'll always leave polished hands for arm wrestling or with perfect toes to play footsie.,2014-12-12,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
6zincCvQTb9BsuK-GHZ4cw,Cheap and good. They had me with online ordering. One of my go to dives for Chicago hot dogs. Triple up with extra peppers because they are that good!!! And if you can't decide, grab the humongous calzone and philly steak sandwich to go. There was a reason I stayed away, it's addictive and I will most likely be back 3x this week!!!!,2014-12-09,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
zrDi4gEaUi64lAMfJU51dw,This place is just classy and unpretentious. I prefer the bar seating but for dinner meetings, you can't go wrong. Everything is fantastic. Service is phenomenal. Bit older crowd but I like sophistication. Wedge salad is perfect starter and dine on steak or the sea bass. While I opted out this time, the sundae is serious orgasmic delight.,2014-10-30,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
cw4m6QjZVG2PkdSYeim1Gg,This is a great park tucked away from the busyness of Old Town. Clean and well lit for your evening runs. There's workout stations if you're ambitiously trying to get fit. Best part, you might get lucky and catch an awesome sunrise\/sunset view that makes those miles worthwhile.,2014-10-24,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
pVCF9rIPF4y697QeRMpweA,The only reason I checked in is because Alex is the most awesome wine master there! This location is beautiful. Houses my fave Starbucks and has an in-store bar. Why shop? Just hang out and have some drinks! Oh grab the Uneducated Guess Cab and Bailey's Vanilla Cinnamon for your stash!,2015-01-10,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
RutjZZAMrGldOI2GSpAT1A,Serious treasure trove, including the shoppers. I would buy them. Always clean and staff is amazing. I get suckered by the wine sale and end up walking out like an alcoholic on red wines.,2014-10-18,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
LAXd3Y4XSy4X9iaHFwqK_A,They have Gold Peak Tea!!!! So delish,2017-07-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
kQoVRCZn_kxTJVNdIvmWiA,Unplug with their happy hour specials and beautiful views of the course!,2017-03-24,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
gZcph0QQElMcXR47W6N13g,The grilled sirloin is great lunch portion of protein and healthiness. Tomatoes were bit overpowered by garlic but still yummy!,2016-01-15,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
sLhPQEYQpSgFpc9xV4M3HQ,So it seems if you come midweek particularly Wednesday you get a free oil change with Yelp checkin. This happy camper will save for next use. Thanks for the love Infiniti!,2016-02-22,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
FW7uAWuXX7YNMHDJyotsgQ,Madhouse is understatement. Could explain why every adult seems to have a drink in hand. The energy will either drain you or energize you to find your inner kid joining them in the jungle gym. Usual games to kill time until the kids pass out.,2014-12-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Hy0jGDoUwcudX2IbDGWWEA,Authentic Thai food. Not for your American palate. I suggest Malee's for those unadventurous. I love the sticky rice and beef jerky with the papaya salad with crab. Just don't plan on kissing a boy. Holy hot dragon breath. Maybe slurp the sukiyaki soup to ease the fire.,2015-03-19,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
-FLnsWAa4AGEW4NgE8Fqew,This place is never short of energy. Come with anticipation of good things come to those who wait. In meantime, grab a latte from coffee bar while waiting for table. Weekends I would recommend coming early and having the pitcher of mimosas. My fave is the steak and eggs or mignon bene. I also like the Lean & Mean omelette. Generous portions so I am the last person to vote for smaller portions. Is that really an issue for some? Pass it over to me then.,2015-01-12,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
925GiWzJ_cxQaUT870xW7A,The music is always good. The crowd is always fun. And the wine selection never disappoints. What more do you need?,2014-10-17,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
91EhRceds781OLo3M4BDrA,Purchased a gift online and was able to do in-store pickup on the same day. During the time they received and processed my order, I was kicking weights around at the gym. Seriously Nordy can you just take over life? While you are at it, can I place an order for my future boyfriend?! This is my idea of mail order. There's reason I am faithful to Nordstrom.,2015-01-05,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
_MVSmAYSl4RkgXBg5e8JaQ,I adore this unassuming spot. Parking is limited and tiny so wait can be long on weekends. I never have waffles unless it is here and it's the coconut waffle. OMG. I feel transported to a paradise vacay. And my other favorite is the Continental Crepes. I would like to smother myself with the sauce. Enough said. My smile is a picture of their perfection.,2015-02-19,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
8o2035AiV8egxfQIxR7dPA,My fave is coconut iced coffee or their regular with two shots hazelnut with soy milk. Always grab the cruellers bc they won't last. Friendly staff and service is good despite busy hours. Patio is loud since you back up against Hayden. Highly suggest walking over to Pig and Pickle after. But that's just me.,2014-12-14,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
moZpwq1hNxC-uJRpfupOTA,Definitely have the tequila shrimp, a bowl of the chicken tortilla and the green chile mac and cheese. It's enough carbs to fill your happy belly content.,2014-10-26,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
moZpwq1hNxC-uJRpfupOTA,Use your Yelp checkin for the chips and salsa. OMG. Such uhmazing salsa both the green and red. I have to admit that the appetizer filet mignon taco plate and bowl of tortilla soup was so filling I had to ask for a to go box. Wow. Happy belly!,2015-01-01,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
6sKaAF8WhWyyCjfZr2Rfsg,This location is smallest I've been but my local dive. It's dark inside so perfect for recovery on hangovers. I prefer patio because well I'm a desert native who likes the heat. Best wings are the honey hot naked, get an extra side of celery!!!! Otherwise grab the burger with green chili. Will say the turkey burger is not bad alternative. I like the eclectic crowd, no one bites and everyone loves football.,2014-10-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
6sKaAF8WhWyyCjfZr2Rfsg,If you need a reward for being good or just want to consume 3000 calories, have the chocolate chip cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream. Soft gooey yet crispy and buttery. Oooeemgee! There's option of white chocolate macadamia or brownie but this seriously is explosions of happiness.,2016-03-10,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w,I love this neighborhood gem especially for late nights at the office bc I can grab HH food and prices anytime from Sunday through Wednesday all night. Order the vodka penne with a side of meatballs (3 in my case. Amaze balls!) with the chicken caesar salad and a glass of Pinot Noir and you feel like an accomplished adult. Cheers!,2016-06-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
KUZc2Y9wOkrTp3ABSPEBKQ,Who says money can't buy happiness never shopped at Trader Joe's. For under $20, you can have a bottle the Caretaker Pinot Noir, chocolate bonbons and fresh lovelies. Date nights are an every day thing here!,2016-02-22,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
qC0Di2wDeUBMSMbz6fdYBw,Really laid back place with a vibe for the natives of St. Louis. Staff is always friendly especially at the bar. Love that Happy Hour is til 7p and full menu til midnight. Could not resist the bison sliders and go to  is the filet cooked perfectly. It's dark so adjust your eyes. Hint to the men, it's the spot if you want to go stealth or check out the eye candy before they start their shift at Babe's.,2015-04-23,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
rZeTXCZajPjXktTFfgxbAA,This is a great spot where for under $10 you can grab a bucket of balls and a drink and take your frustrations out. Work on your swing til dark if you have to. It's well lit and open til 9pm. By then, you'll recover from a crappy day :),2014-10-06,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
67zCgILB2h6JoSvFabVe7g,If you must eat, consume 3000 calories. In honor of such lofty goals, have the water chestnuts (OMG, bacon, cucumber and radish with honey dip...that's healthy) along with the St. Petersburg potatoes ( salmon, carbs...perfect post workout). The tuna nicoise is a good alternative to their burger au poivre. That's my idea of beefcakes. Oh I highly suggest the summer solstice martini. Cheers to toasty toes and cozy afternoons!,2014-11-14,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
67zCgILB2h6JoSvFabVe7g,My latest crush is the Bonfire Chicken! OMG. Cole slaw was perfect side and who would ever think to pair sour cream with the chicken as a dipping sauce. You have me. Done done and done.,2015-05-06,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g,One of my top 3 faves in Arcadia\/Biltmore area for burgers. Prefer patio. Never short of a crowd so patience my hungry ones. Have the cart of sweet potato fries, dip in all the sauces. Delux Burger is enough for two but I don't share and my body likes protein. All mine. Oh the veggie burger isn't bad, but why bother. If you're coming here, just eat meat. Shakes are so so good if you can't partake on the beer flights. Love late night runs here to feed my hunger bc the crowd is worth it!,2014-12-12,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
dg5cg298SXZVMo4ZEwSUtg,I stinkin adore this place. Gelato. Enough said. And they carry Pokett coffee, chocolate  and peanut butter for my mesmerized lips. I love the pirouettes in a waffle cone. Yes I'm that kid with 3 scoops. And it's next to a coffee shop and my fave brunch spot if you need more reason to eat. I will never leave here :\/,2014-11-29,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
vUDqNV3RhI3FmZRwS7039g,Happy hour in the lounge is til 7p. Amaze balls choices. Loved the caramel appletini. But definitely have Uppercut Cab. Bummed closing at end of month but happy to know you can find them at old Kincads spot. Get the escargot, ahi tuna and also Blue Point oysters. That's just starters!!!!,2016-04-14,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
4pKPiKAX9qm8TU-bOt7Pmw,One of my top choices for steak and martinis. Have the Stoli Doli martini, or several in my case, with the Delmonico steak. If you are watching your waistline, have the 10oz filet. Pair that with the wild mushrooms and potato au gratin. Oh start off with the calamari. Love the spice level.  Nothing compares. This is coming from a Thai person who loves spice and a meat lover.,2015-02-25,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
p-8AMN9Q0qwym-3Pdle20Q,Awesome happy hour. Love the sangria, grab a pitcher! Of course the hummus is so good. I tried all and plain ole traditional still as yummy as others. Ask for extra cucumbers. My go to is the chicken shawarma with extra pickles. Ooze of goodness. My fave post workout option is the broiled chicken pasta salad or the ahi salad. Delishness!,2014-12-09,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
YQFcxE9UXrKc-QuTUu7twQ,Top choices are the Mexican street tacos, lobster tacos and the coconut shrimp tacos. OMG. And have the iceberg to wash it all down!,2015-11-28,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
3Hu-IPhq5I_jyb3YfeHpGQ,They have the best coffee and pairing it with the banana nut pancakes and a small fruit salad, I don't know how you can't have an amazing morning. The fruit salad is my fuel with this to die for yogurt and granola.,2014-07-01,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Noi53T0PWNEN9mQRS3-Ncg,Couldn't agree more with Yelpers. My fave is the breakfast buzz with an extra shot and certainly the oatmeal. Anyone who can make this simple item so heavenly with steamed milk and vanilla macaron oatmeal will always have my happy heart.,2015-07-30,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g,Little disappointed even if you charge me $0.65 a person. Everything but 2 items were deep fried. Not the usual suspects at a dim sum to be found like chicken feet, thousand year old egg soup, etc. because that's what the natives eat!!! This soy sauce collection of finger foods is sub par for an Asian buffet. Top highlight frosted mug for beer and the savory duck.,2014-11-09,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
paWti26uib0RmBJIn6xL9w,OMG this is THE carnivore's heaven. There's animals everywhere to delight your tastebuds. You can find cuts of meat for reasonable prices! Definitely come when they have BBQ day. The smoked brisket with Mac n cheese is the best I've had hands down. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable with quick service.,2017-06-09,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
2Jq0XuOc0xZ-IshXGSG9yg,The building is so beautifully done for an agency. I love that there's a Starbucks as well as an art gallery. Currently the hall exhibit is the Art of Calligraphy. It's nice to stop and explore during the hustle of a work day.,2016-03-11,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Ja4stXdNYr39u5CZHMNtjw,The ceviche is so good. I suggest adding cholula if you want extra spice. Hands down my fave is the tinga tacos and beef tacos. That's fried goodness at it's best. Awesome staff and fun patrons to chat with!,2015-04-07,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw,Personally prefer sitting at the bar or sushi table. Definitely the blood orange margarita will kick off your night or if you like to be a bit frisky, try the Hani Pru with the sochu. Amaze balls!!!,2014-08-08,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw,Always sit at the bar. Have Jason tend to your culinary needs. He's amaze balls!!!! Don't forego the tuna flight, any and all are pure artistic beauty. Top faves are the Robata grilled scallops, pepper calamari and ask for the tempura corn (it's off the menu but I'm willing to trade insider secrets). MUST have the white chocolate brownie. Serious happiness eruptions!!!,2015-01-22,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw,If you didn't make it for their special on international sushi day, you missed out and I scored! The sashimi platter came with oysters, an amazing roll and nigiri selection. Who doesn't want omega 3 intake like that? And now they extended HH all night every night.Butterfish tataki. Seriously should I just live here? Derek takes care of you like you are the only customer he waits on. When you have Mirnes and chef Jason chatting up with you, you really feel like you own the place! Lala love Roka!,2015-06-19,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg,I rarely, correction never, come here without indulging in a steak or dessert. However my curiosity of what is avail to others got the best of me. I have to say the Chilean sea bass is incredibly mouthwatering, add a side of Mac and Cheese and scallop potatoes and you might be distracted from the lack of protein usually abundant. Any of the sides are uh-mazing!!! Service is always spot on so it's always a pleasurable experience.,2014-11-02,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
sLKpRaFns5Uqw1IEzK6obA,Best bang for buck. So delish. Grab a gyro combo with a side salad to be healthy. Or go gusto with the gyro dinner plate. Be me and do both. Fresh pita. OMG. I love their food. Happy faces always at the drive thru.,2014-12-10,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
-kGpAJBGe1MugHTr91vIdQ,This bar is a classic in a town of pretentiousness. Where else can you go grab shots and cocktails under $20? And we drink like thirsty camels my friends, it's the desert. Leave your ego in the parking lot. Chill out and have good convo with cool ass people.,2015-02-23,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Sy75QB18Sv-xNp8FoA8KvQ,Seriously best way to end your weekend!!! Sundays are the best with amazing energy, good beats, pretty people, and half off menu. What's not to like? Get the fried rice, chicken lettuce wraps, pork gyoza and ribs. It will soak up all the sake bombers. Get here and stay all night!,2015-01-25,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
GWnhc3MO4XjsKIpyExV--Q,The tuna taco is uhmazing!!! I can't get enough of the spice and sweetness bursting in my tongue. Staff is so sweet and accommodating. Get the grapefruit sushi to clean your plate.,2015-12-20,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
F-PmkzyN80fVcNMN8Z2aiw,Love the happy hour. Kinda loud though and have to lean in to hear people. Perfect excuse to get close I guess. Only time I use butter bc you can't help it with the cornbread. Love the shrimp tostadas and the skillet dumplings. The pork chile is uhmazing. And if you have room eat the grilled ruby trout. Amaze balls.,2014-11-20,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
96ou1MqdJjyeSqzCLZMqcg,The seasonal special is worth a few dollar upgrade to get carpets shampooed. Honestly my fave location. Great service, friendly happy workers and quick turnaround. Happy customer,2014-09-14,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
1guXy9zezoqBX-bxnT_F6Q,It's good to lose yourself once in awhile. In food, in wine, in cooking, in love. Let yourself get lost. This squid ink risotto with chorizo was phenomenal with the Malbec. Ooeemmggee. Had the most uhmazing time at this 5 course dinner and wine pairing. Thank you Chef Lou and sommelier Christine!,2016-11-19,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
s_466owgNXqmQRuSluHHEQ,Let's face it. It's the W. It oozes sexy. It's always going to be a good time. A sure thing. Any one can fit in, just channel your seductive side. If you can't find it, the bartenders will help you in a heartbeat. Best blueberry vodka concoction at the downstairs bar. And he serves it with a hallpass for trouble :),2014-12-05,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ,Their salads, my fave is the avocado citrus, are crazy size proportions making it worth every penny. However, not so great on your waistline unless you have self control. The rosemary steak and eggs are best hangover cure with the mimosas. And I can't refuse their happy hour when you get the seasonal beer for $1. Go hog wild. No guilt my friends :),2014-09-23,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
AG3ynzeURTDLt3hV6LmPiA,See Monica at window 6. She's a unicorn. Love her. Friendly. Customer service oriented and she makes you smile.,2014-10-29,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
fjapWp89YVCeKvW51KUDQw,I stinkin adore Luci's place!!!! Not only is it great people watching, you can shop for amazing healthy stuff and eat incredible food. Just the name is so whimsical. I love having mimosas with their acai bowl or the lox and bagel plate. I wish I lived closer.,2015-01-11,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ,Great ambience. Amazing place to indulge in delish carbs. Have the spicy BBQ chicken pizza and the funguni pizza (add sausage) and use your Yelp checkin for a free dessert. My choice is the deep fried carrot cake balls. Yes. My sentiments exactly. If you are going to gorge go balls out!!! Amaze balls.,2015-01-28,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
iPPzDL_oY8SJCjmycuXcVg,Beer or smoothie? Geez the option is hard. Love that no where else will you get that as a choice :),2014-09-29,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
iJi7yebXoPVXRyGqqL-v8g,One of my top go to. Happy hour. Meet up. Show up. Hidden gem. Friendly staff. Love the live music. Food is delish. Patio is inviting. Bar is cozy. Just get here.,2014-10-29,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
fKm6mfATDJRDDQH0PtZeeQ,Tried the sweet crepes and were a bit doughy than I like. Not a fan of the honey drizzle and could have used more chocolate filling. Did enjoy the amount of side bacon and crispness.,2016-07-16,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
pxCchlWQm8rM8pbcPg6R1g,This is golf heaven for anyone especially women. Only place I find large selection of actually fashionable golf outing wear but with a pretty penny. But is golf really a cheap sport? They have great staff ready to assist in your needs for drivers, clubs, balls and even lessons. It's like Legoland for adults. Or I am just a big kid :),2014-11-19,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w,The nori sliders are such a creative and filling choice. The crispy seaweed adds crunch to the ahi tuna. Presentation is eye catching. They are so good. Will have to venture back when I complete my meatless month challenge.,2014-10-03,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w,My fave neighborhood gem that is always overlooked. Thank goodness so it can be my very own ultimate cave. Staff is just cool. They stopped serving the ahi sliders as an app. But try the slider entree. You won't be disappointed for a sample of the BLT, sweet and spicy and the peppercorn burgers. If your appetite is big enough, just get the adult size Sweet and Spicy burger with their herb fries. Go big or Go home.,2015-05-26,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw,The DJ will make you dance more than eat or drink. He's seriously bad ass. Food is meh. Drinks are pricey unless you do the brunch bottomless where someone has to carry you out from having too much fun.,2015-05-26,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Pfi812k1E6TMnC1NRzH3Pg,Service is impeccable. There is no bad seat in this restaurant. Have the rib eye with the wine sauce and sautéed mushrooms. OMG. I had a major orgasmic outburst. Talk to me with cow that's cooked perfectly medium rare with a side of wild mushrooms. Sold. And then top it off with the dessert. The chocolate tarte with the caramelized bananas seriously made love to my tastebuds.,2014-11-30,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
UPF6nUKB_kbMM44xiEc66g,The Korean short ribs are so delish! I love love the shrimp kung pow. Definite fave spot. A bit loud but love love vibe :),2011-10-06,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
k1c_bC3DK6mKg797vH1T8w,The lobster ravioli converted me to a carb lover...it is scrumptious following the buratta cheese and heirloom tomato plate. Yummy!,2011-06-24,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
I2gsUx1W5-gQzBFbhIxcRQ,I like chill spots and this definitely fits the bill. I adore it even more when I can walk out with a tab less than $25 including food and pitcher of beer! Love that the wings are grilled. If you come and they offer the rib plate, get it! So tender and moist. Falls off the bone. Bonus, the side salad is almost an entire entree. I hear 1\/2 burgers on Saturdays are the bomb. Will be back to test the rumor. And who knew they offered track betting if you like playing the odds!,2015-10-15,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
jQLUjl-xirPpYa1dYzos9w,It's intimidating but makes you want to up your game. Why not? Who doesn't want to be fit and healthy! This is a gym for serious fitness people. Clean. Weights are well maintained. Spacious for those lunges and every torture the trainer wants to put you through. Staff is incredibly friendly with a no pressure sales approach. Trainer Hank is a rockstar and I'm a big fan!,2015-03-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
0jAexNHRHhkQv4zNYqenBA,Great spot to watch the games bc the patio is open and tons of TV screens to delight your eyes. Taco Tuesdays is good for $2 tacos and $3 Dos XX. Get the carne asada, al pastor, shrimp, and duck carnitas for sure. Generous with meat portions. Not on special but I love the street corn too! HH is 3-7 but tacos are the only deal along with beer. DO NOT order the Corona with Bacardi Limon and stick to the Dos!,2015-06-10,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
dF11zSNDXbq6DBchUvqgZQ,Try the sofritas. Tofu never tasted so good or spicy like this. And a great alternative to meatless Friday or if you want to be vegan which I'm not :),2014-09-26,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA,Best coffee with the most artistic presentation. Good music. Creative vibe. Just get here. Then stay. Awhile.,2014-10-23,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA,Have the white chocolate cranberry cookie and the chocolate brownie with cheesecake filling. I seriously am in utter bliss. Not too sweet but just rich and delightful tantalizing partner for your cappuccino or latte.,2014-12-18,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA,You MUST have the cowgirl cookie, or two in my case. White chocolate with cranberry, delightfully blissful. This is an instant mood changer with the chai!,2015-01-06,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA,Honestly Cartel. I am in love with you. Your staff. Your cappuccino. Your cowgirl cookie. You are utter happiness to me. I cannot get enough.,2015-02-19,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
r8764MtYyt8JhxMvrfM_xQ,Wonderful ambience in an amazing setting. The bruschetta was good but prefer my bread crunchier to hold the flavor. I would recommend the charcuterie board. Service is very attentive & knowledgable.,2013-01-05,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
o0Sf-45xsWv3odbEC1XMbg,The egg rolls are amazing, the right amount of crunch to maximize the flavors inside. The pho is phenomenal, fragrant and aromatic to the senses before you even add the fresh basil and spices. They are so unobtrusive and generous with the servings. Definite new fave dive!,2013-02-24,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
wJY74R0zAgjxvBf-d4gm9g,Happy hour is til 8p on Tuesdays. Forget taco Tuesday. We do tipsy Tuesday,2016-02-23,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
9iJa370SdefztNplnESMoQ,Love this location. Always friendly cashiers and happy shoppers, sprinkled with a dose of eye candy to tempt you to walk every aisles. My fave spot to get chicken sausage and the best Brussels sprouts. Not to mention they carry local bee pollen for any of my sneezy friends :),2014-10-11,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
NRLsHNbEPpQfaAYS5OLGxg,Come during spa week which lasts til Sunday and you can get a massage, facial or body scrub for only $50!!!! I recommend Colleen as she used the right amount of pressure to take out my knots. Feel free to use the resort afterwards, it's beautiful amidst this desert landscape. I recommend having drinks on the patio overlooking the beautiful city lights.,2017-04-18,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
5d8oCuD4TlaDjBGMnDD0HQ,Totally agree with my Yelpers. Get the multigrain bread skinny. Perfect crunch. Love the Grilled Chicken and Roast Beef, add mushrooms and the hot peppers. Warning peppers are spicy! The Chicken Salad salad (not typo) is way generous and delish without the potbelly dressing. Even at lunch hour, in and out in less than 20 minutes. I am a BIG fan!!!,2015-04-29,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
5sqC0kX6lBvKR983T_EBcg,The sweet pork tacos are yum. Grab the salsa if you want more of a sweet and spicy flavor. Generous in portion and wonderful staff!,2015-05-29,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ,Incredible service. Spacious layout with windows that open so you always have fresh air and sunshine. Love the big screen TVs too. Cannot resist their happy hour!!!! Best white peach sangria. Grab oysters, both east and west coast flavors for only $1. Must double order the grilled artichoke. That sauce is pure decadence. And I highly suggest the wild mushroom and chicken pesto pizza. That is all. Carry on and eat a lot!!!!!,2014-11-30,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Rg43a31sV7gNLZMjy-ZdCg,Sit on patio or at the bar. Not a big tator tot person but everyone raves of them. I prefer duck fat fries, wood oven roasted bone marrow and the udon noodles with pork belly, what else!?! As for drinks, had me at Sonoran White Chocolate and Big Sky Moose Drool. Oh the beer list is over 20 types of the ""real deal."" Sweet mother of beer!!! Someone pick me up and drag me out of here. This place is perfect for late night cravings.,2015-01-07,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
RHO331ipxuIYqvmn__Sxwg,You would be doing a disservice to yourself if you didn't sit on the patio. BIG I mean huge fan of the pretzel knots. Eat alone or go wild with the sauce. Cannot get enough of it. Definitely am in hog heaven over the mussels. OMG, when you throw coconut with sambal chili and scallions, it is pure utter explosion of goodness! Naturally my fave concoction to flirt with these melodies is the Moscow mule. Not the traditional version but I'm a bourbon girl. Happy belly happy face.,2014-06-02,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
zxWWB54SvtRMa0XcKAhe5g,This is a wonderful experience for wine lovers to have their own collection. I am disappointed they stopped the beer option for those who prefer brews. Plenty of choices of wine but I recommend the Delano Cabernet or New Zealand Pinot Noir. Staff is friendly and personable.,2016-07-20,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A,Aside that it has a butcher shop, which in itself is OMG but reserved for another time, MUST have the shrimp tamales and the green chile white cheddar mac and cheese. Serious spillage of goodness in your mouth. The prices are deceiving of the quality fare,2014-11-10,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A,Sundays are now open at 9a serving their special burritos. I highly recommend the steak burrito and the blind pig which has chorizo. These are super sized for a big appetite! OMG. Mornings get better here!,2015-10-04,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA,Best spot after my workout. Seriously grab a burger with grilled jalapeños and a chocolate shake. You'll finish the shake before the burger makes its way to your mouth. And if I kicked ass I usually grab the short rib tacos too. What can I say? It does your body good :),2014-12-04,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
wHn5ekrhv_DsH2p3fjAung,Love all the baristas here. Vicki is pure sunshine and Ken has the best smile. Tammy prepares the best peppermint white mocha. She always gives you extra sprinkles of chocolate goodness.,2015-01-14,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
D-2t7fHQu6hNLjjfRHSZaA,Great eye candy for bar service. Mondays are $20 for bottle of wine and pasta. Have to say the fennel sausage was better choice than gnocchi which was way too salty. But great reason to finish the bottle of wine. Happy hour daily til 7p with great food items like bone marrow and beef tongue sandwich. Very chill vibe.,2016-02-18,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
1nno5CjwR2JwUHMGZp2AzA,Apparently water is now charged! It is frickin Arizona and tap water. Wow Starbucks.,2017-09-10,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
xR1gLCH5resvtq1eV1nebg,Hilarious quotes on drinks. Love the encyclopedia list of beers. Awesome patio if you can snag spot. Build your own burger for the same cost as what's on menu but with what you want. Love love the french fries. Was not fan of Chicago hot dog. Overkill on relish. And stop changing the channels on games with less than 2 minutes left of play!,2015-03-30,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
ArmAaGCdCVAlkhdtaT6RzQ,Great spot if you want to tune out on convo bc it's noisy. It's always hoppin so skip the line and sit at bar for better people watching and ease on the wait staff rushing to attend to everyone. Love the Bison burger. Milkshakes are ok if you like sucking out of boba size straws. Parmesan truffle fries are good but I like more and bigger in size please.,2016-07-25,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
1HnYxHZw2icWQ7-T4AmQ0Q,Small and cozy. Amaze balls food and off the chart service and wonderful staff. My new fave spot for beer, wings, pizza and Chicago hot dogs. Yes I ate all that in one seating.,2015-03-03,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
1HnYxHZw2icWQ7-T4AmQ0Q,I stinkin adore this place. Staff is so cool. Different specials to entice you to stay awhile. Eat the jalapeño honey wings with a pitcher while you listen to the fun energy of the staff. Seriously best thin crust pizza ever. Even the cooks are having a blast!,2015-05-22,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
mj_E2SThbggt-FyUaE1DQg,One of my fave spots and happy they are more now in Arcadia. You will not be disappointed by the quiche or the big breakfast, that jam is the star of the plate. However my ultimate fave is the huevos frenchos. Avocado, enough said. I always have room for the pain au chocolate next to the chocolate almond croissant and naturally macarons. The coffee will always leave a smile on your lips paired with those. Utter bliss,2014-11-16,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
LelAlfuj5oVRF9CQdWLsNQ,Sit out patio fireside and savor the medley of short rib potstickers, duck confit flatbread, and white truffle Parmesan fries. Pure Goodness. Then make room for the bread pudding and coffee to close out your caloric intake. Warning coffee is very strong!,2014-12-18,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
LelAlfuj5oVRF9CQdWLsNQ,Lunch is a zoo with parking but I love the buzzing energy. Definitely attracts dockers taking up tables. Have the potstickers for starters and definitely grab the lobster salad. I love the snap pea crunch with the juicy lobster and tangy grapefruit. It's generous in portion but bit pricey.,2016-04-26,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
LelAlfuj5oVRF9CQdWLsNQ,When you can convert a total beefeater to devour a bowl of ruffage, you know it's da bomb. Because I'm suffering a current aversion to lobster, I have said before that the Butter Lobster salad was killer. However it's serious contender is the highly recommended Grilled Vegetable Summer salad. That green goddess yogurt should be all over my face. Oooeemgee!!!! Where did all this goodness come from??? Will not be disappointed.,2016-08-05,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Gw-ozqLSHoP3BQPKaiXJGg,My fave pairing is the sliders with the house salad which is generous,  add the shrimp for topping. Have the Kronenburg Blanc to balance the kick! And don't forego patio seating to catch the beautiful sunsets :),2014-09-01,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw,Definitely have the lamb burger! Would actually ask for medium cooked. OMG the bun is such a buttery soft croissant roll and the muenster cheese and fresh mint bring the burger together. Side salad and fries finish the combo off perfectly!,2014-12-23,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw,You MUST have the mussels. This is now one of my fave spots for my weakness. The sauce is incredible. While there is no bread to dip, the side of fries is uhmazing substitute!!!!,2015-01-10,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
7aOaX7QASqa8ab8eAx8TEA,Best sit and wash ever. Their vacuum sucks up anything you don't want, even an unwanted passenger,2014-09-23,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
qxNKPJfuklMxwPbkHLHeWQ,Couldn't agree more with my tippers and reviewers. Have the Raspberry Martini to start your evening. The calamari is perfect teaser and if you must be healthy have the kale Caesar. We couldn't help swooning over the niman pork chop and of course mac'n'cheese.,2016-04-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
qxNKPJfuklMxwPbkHLHeWQ,Seriously love their happy hour menu. Outside of that, get their wild mushroom soup if it's avail. It is ridiculously good and perfect on a rainy day like today. The calamari is always a go to choice along with a bottle of Educated Guess. Service is wonderful and friendly.,2017-01-19,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
7OQ7lhIsjLSmf-3012LAuw,Love this location. They serve alcohol unlike the Old Town location. Definitely have the balanced bowl for breakfast or the acai bowl and any of the protein bowls for lunch. And if you're still hungry, have the Jacked Up PB&J shake. Who needs to count calories when you are working out?!!!,2015-03-24,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
0859wfd1BQHG46Zpwhc0ZQ,Love love love this place. We have an intense relationship. How can you not with HH from 11-6? Seriously that's love. Best carb indulgence. New crush is the Bianca flatbread,2014-10-29,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
0OxEVzBKDmTP7GdSmhi3ow,Go big and get the Big Kahuna. Double the meat. Double the fixings. Love the spice. Worth every stinkin cheesy drip of goodness. Oh they offer Gatorade for those recovery days after weekend shenanigans.,2015-07-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
ctzH0uqGz6q_o2nuCrAUvA,The best green tea I've had. The miso soup is so flavorful. The complimentary salad has a great sesame ginger dressing. The beef teriyaki and tempura lunch specials are so delish!,2015-01-09,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
YPjz8wGG1GhiWfI0sHgb9A,Always did like it as Martini Ranch and being Wasted Grain only changed their game for the better. Bartenders are hot and serve us thirsty camels a smile with your cold beverage. Love the chill atmosphere with friendly patrons and certainly my new fave spot to watch Arizona Wildcats basketball.,2015-03-27,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
XaPJUDiidOOdAMhTTIlTxw,I adore the sister winebar Whining Pig. Quirky spot with eclectic people. It's a throwback to childhood fun so be ready to chalk on the walls your inner graffiti artist or bring out your competitive nature on Connect Four. Love the old school video games like Mortal Combat. We ate before but agree that it is amaze balls grilled cheese no doubt. Great wine selections. Staff is friendly, space is perfect for cozing up. Just make sure you like the person next to you ;),2014-11-30,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A,Service is really attentive and on point. I would recommend indoor seating but patio was really lovely with the vibrant colors and decor. Try the salmon ravioli and fried chicken. Both unique and delish in their preparation.,2015-01-15,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
u73j2VQ3TGWdMO-AG7MABw,Love the new layout. Sit at the bar and have Gabe attend to your whims. Keenan is a complete stand up comedy act in himself. Food is always consistent. Staff on point. This isn't KFC so don't think you're getting out of there with a fast food budget!,2015-07-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
hr_lJ5EtUy2U-I9cNQegyg,You can't go wrong with any of the crepes. Perfect portions to feed a hangover, share or simply a tiny person with big linebacker appetite. Chicken sausage has so much flavor from the avocado hollandaise sauce. Highly recommend the side of potatos, perfect crunch with serious carb goodness. The Nutella and banana crepe will feed your sweet tooth. Love the decor of fresh flowers and cheerful art work. New fave hidden gem.,2014-11-02,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
vrKcFQPxj1Zzyj93yl-t6g,This is more family oriented and relaxing than the Scottsdale one. The Bloody Mary is uhmazing! Love the wings and donut holes with the filling shots of raspberry, cream and chocolate. Perfect family outing spot!,2015-01-04,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
9JyyXlFBHCdoP6TRQ3cqbA,Great space and love the patio. Parking is bit hassle in this plaza though cool they have electric charging stations for EV! Burnt fried rice was literally burnt. No flavor even with sriracha. Try the bison burger instead. Happy hour is nice since it lasts til 7p.,2016-02-18,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
9JyyXlFBHCdoP6TRQ3cqbA,MUST have the bison burger with egg. OMG that slab of meat is ridiculously good. It's playing hide and seek from the egg. Fries are perfectly salted and crunchy. Too bad couldn't have beer to pair with this but you should!,2016-03-02,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
9JyyXlFBHCdoP6TRQ3cqbA,The hours are incorrect. They no longer are open for lunch. They open at 3p just in time for happy hour!,2017-05-22,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
NAPuzJcanOp91dE4GXPOow,Loved the remodel. Actually thought I was soaking up ocean kisses and salty air. Beautiful patio. Drinks were meh and service was spotty but it's relatively new for Old Town.,2015-02-23,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
IY09uHwNvznCUDoFZ_su3A,Love the space and decor. Patio is perfect for spring and people watching. Three TVs is underwhelming for such a spacious layout. Staff is friendly and personable. Have the bacon and cheese fries. Or try the wings and there's plenty of beer to choose from like the Wobble IPA and Prairie Path Ale. I dig the bar area with all the beers on draft, though having frosted glasses would be a better tasting experience.,2015-03-27,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
goi1r30_CjH9TymbMs9OwQ,Great setup. Amazing live music. Staff is so friendly and accommodating. Order the cheese bites to start followed by the cubano with tomato basil soup and call it a perfect night under a blanket of stars! Checkin with Yelp and get 15% off your tab!!!!,2015-10-08,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Xfc-B8XUPkvvYoy5eVFO4w,Couldn't agree more with my Yelpers! Love the remodel from when it was Spotted Donkey. Great patio and beautiful decor. Have the sparkling rose with the Ocean Salt Artichoke. Must try the Crab Cake & Green Salad or the Shrimp Buckwheat Kale Noodle Salad. I had both! I wasn't impressed by the Strawberry Shortcake bc it wasn't traditional and I wasn't expecting a scone.,2015-04-12,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Xfc-B8XUPkvvYoy5eVFO4w,Order the Caesar salad with steak, no dressing and topped with an egg and you'll never doubt me or the healthy choices you make. The croutons are perfect crunch with this lightness. Hard to believe the small size is that filling.,2016-07-22,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Xfc-B8XUPkvvYoy5eVFO4w,Definitely order the crab\/lobster Mac and cheese while it's on the menu. How could you possibly go wrong???? And if you order the Rotisserie chicken it's basically Thanksgiving in a plate. The pork chops are so uhmazing that all you'll hear are sounds of a ravenous carnivore out of your dinner companion. Kayla is incredibly sweet at serving up smiles and happiness. I recommend the Chain Breaker IPA  and Prima Pilsner to quench your thirst.,2016-10-21,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Xfc-B8XUPkvvYoy5eVFO4w,Awesome brunch! Love the strawberry purée mimosa with vanilla bean sugar rim. Waffles come in a caramel butter. Think about that. OMG the cowboy style two potato hash is amaze balls. Then finish off with the tres leches dessert. You my friend just had a major food orgasm in your mouth. You can thank me and John the bartender for this happy ending.,2016-11-12,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Xfc-B8XUPkvvYoy5eVFO4w,It is always sunshine and smiles in AZ with the sunny Cobb. Healthy and an overly generous portion, I prefer the dressing and blue cheese on the side bc the salad already has great flavor from the sweet fried onions and the moist chicken.,2017-02-22,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
qxlZ-hy9MIses8t65uDkkA,If you want a chill pool party without the usual gambit of craziness, grab a chair, get a tan, and come listen to DJ Sean Derek spin some seriously good tunes that will make you forget the work week. Hotel staff is some of the coolest peeps with awesome service. My kind of staycation!!!,2015-05-26,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
rjN0pSDqagyc7h8ihT0dVw,Who doesn't think life is sweeter with ice cream living in the desert!?!?!! You definitely can't beat $2 for the perfect treat of ice cream and cookies. OMG. Cookies have the right crunch with delish ice cream. Park in the back if you can snag a spot.,2016-07-09,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
jKN5rK1p9iKFjChWVdb6Ww,Love the remodel of the spot. Staff is uhmazing and you'll find the same faces at the Gilbert location. Who doesn't want to chill here especially when they carry every variety of my fave Perdomo cigars?!?!!! Drinks are unbelievably affordable. No excuse to not send one over gentlemen! Here's a tip -try the tequila made especially for Fox. No regrets. And that's sexy to us woman entering in this sanctuary.,2015-07-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
h8uTK7J0uNYlMVMNhI0f6g,Attended a work seminar and was pleasantly surprised by this little gem. Almost a mirage amidst the Riverview area. Beautiful decor, wonderful staff and definitely gorgeous landscaping. Love the lake outside along with the Starbucks. Heck 24hour Fitness is around corner but the hotel gym looked more inviting.,2015-06-19,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
iQAwmfMPmOaCr5aeahV1ug,Breakfast til 130p on weekends during football season. Have the hoppy bitch IPA though they limit you 3 due to the alcohol content.,2015-11-22,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
Ap17p-tA4Ipzy1s35DfCfg,Love that HH is til 7p even on Saturdays. You can eat all the fresh oysters for half off and it's not often that you can find a 25yo Macallan or a 17yo Balvenie. Definitely get the baked yuzu crab roll, perfect blend of sweet and spicy. I love you Buck & Rider and weekends too!!!,2017-01-21,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
QhCzkwMzNa6aSFnsQuFPeQ,I love the vibe here. Perfect to end a work week and great spot to just chill with friends. There is no doubt that the bourbon almonds will entice you to drink up. But it's the Mac and Cheese and IPA-battered fried chicken that is the spotlighter. Chicken gravy smothered over the red potatoes and the crunch on the chicken is unmatchable even by the Colonel Sanders himself. I also spied the Steak and Taters as one delish contender. I'll be back often and hungry and thirsty!,2017-01-07,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
QhCzkwMzNa6aSFnsQuFPeQ,Such a cool hipster spot with a retro vibe. Attentive and friendly staff and patrons. Park your butt inside or out, you'll never be short of eye candy. On weekends there's a cover charge for the live music but it's only $3. Drink up and soak in the vibe of being very Mad Men.,2017-01-07,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
PxTKXsdYqoFHWAG2amz0XQ,If you don't trip falling in love with the interior of the hotel leading to this gem, then you'll trip over the goodness on the menu. I love love love the grilled romaine salad with grilled salmon. Deconstructed but art on a platter. My next choice is the breakfast salad. Who turns down Parmesan crusted fried egg???? Quick for business lunches though I'd like to linger longer. Can't wait until my next visit!,2017-06-30,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
NWjJK9c5YOQSbMX_bw24sA,Nice happy hour specials on the drinks. Love the chill vibe. The clam chowder was pretty good with a splash of hot sauce. Love the crab cakes.,2016-04-19,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
ytAsW7DYezxMMzqoO_-nIQ,OMG. How to create happiness and experience heaven on earth... eat the Holy Sunday. This is serious neutron bombs of happiness. It takes like a churro but on steroids of heavenly bliss. And your butt will thank you for it!,2016-05-13,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
ytAsW7DYezxMMzqoO_-nIQ,The ahi poke is hands down the bomb. Lalalala love the spicy flavor. My ultimate crush is definitely the Brussels sprouts with bacon. The Rosemary chicken with bacon risotto is killer. Omg!!! Orgasmic. And on Mondays if you order two entrees and drinks, dessert is on them !!!,2016-04-18,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
o86OGfW63bVqWkIrvxcEQQ,Definitely order the Grayson Cab with your bruschetta board while it's on the menu!!! Major orgasmic eruptions.,2017-01-10,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
EM4Qo0Tm40H8Nfk3s8Dy0g,It's tricky but you have to enter through the back to get to this cool spot. Perfect spot to just chill with friends. There's no doubt that the bourbon almonds will entice you to drink up. But the Mac and Cheese and IPA-battered fried chicken that is the spotlighter. Chicken gravy smothered over the red potatoes and the crunch on the chicken is unmatchable even by the Colonel Sanders himself. I also spied the Steak and Taters as one delish contender. I'll be back often and hungry and thirsty!,2017-01-07,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
VF4KH9JVolOeo2XojphthQ,Happy hour lasts til 7p and the brussel sprouts are my fave and great drink selection. Sit in the bar and enjoy the live music. Came here during their Monday $10 lobster special. Definitely worth it but today was last of that deal. Love the bar decor, especially the guitar features.,2017-03-06,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
x0dMACZ3NlDWTDyFAW0jHw,Seriously love the remodel. The lounge invites you to stay longer. Place looks amazing and much more upscale. Great menu and this almost pars with iPic. Staff is super sweet and friendly.,2016-10-22,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
XmxRXzCFkzQK23kkHgUgLA,Tucked behind Seasons 52, this cute little spot is cheerful with its colorful industrial look. Not too crowded or loud, perfect for lunch meetings. Service is attentive and quick. Love love love the hot Indian Spice Chai tea with honey and milk. Definitely have the Quinoa and Kale salad with the organic chicken. Generous portion and the pine nuts and grapes let you forget you're eating healthy. Can't wait to come back for their weekend brunch!,2017-01-31,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw
LkmrqzFEImqzfKbJxSrwEA,Such a cute concept and much needed. Small but modern with such a happy menu board. While I'll say my ramen is far better, this is pretty good. You order at the tablets and wait for the yumminess. I tried the gomo house specialty. Was good sauce and perfect noodles but needed spice. Add spice with their hot sauce. Great specials on beer and pork buns. Definitely will come back to try other options.,2017-05-04,zEBjQm_S26TI1Etpvie9sw

Nc7-nyG_RzXrEqBuxihcgQ,If you like good service, do not, I repeat, do not sit in the bar area (even if they push it on you). There is something operationally wrong with their setup because it never fails - service is too slow, food takes forever, drink refills never happen - they either stretch the servers too far or put their underperformers in the bar. This is a problem at every BJs I've been to.,2013-09-07,ZYdPYCi5UP75TrcGZV1FjA

3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ,Friday\/Saturday nights are really not recommended. The line gets super long and there's no telling how long the wait will be. They really should consider a hostess setup on nights like this (or better yet, reservations) I usually cannot sing enough praises of LM, but this is the second time I've been burnt by the same scenario.,2014-01-03,ZYdPYCi5UP75TrcGZV1FjA

lKIDHvxHpyhruR_J9P42wg,I had such high hopes but this place is bullshit. The kid on the phone barely understood English and delivery took so long the wings were dry & cold and the ranch had SEPARATED. It takes a long time for ranch to separate, friends.

nXKaLgLuLs2-S8_O-V09-A,We must have been there on an off day because we found the burgers to be bland and the service rude and snippy. There are simply too many other good burgers in Phoenix to bother returning to two hippies.,2013-06-03,il4Cs5b2x-6dl5VXw1Z7lQ
L9B_KWfmkWldO_F3nczutQ,The owner, or manager, of this place is extremely protective of his animals. That's a good thing. What's bad is that he shuffled over and stood wordlessly behind me when he thought I might be tapping on the glass of an anole terrarium, which I was not. Maybe try engaging the customer when you suspect them of being out of line rather than passive-agressively acting like a hardass.,2013-04-04,il4Cs5b2x-6dl5VXw1Z7lQ
-Bdw-5H5C4AYSMGnAvmnzw,Strange food, atrocious cocktails, and really nice service here. If I return it'll only be to try the chicken & waffle I've read so much about.,2013-01-03,il4Cs5b2x-6dl5VXw1Z7lQ

rOKEgdzmhzT99Ob_OmPE0Q,I like this place but I need to point out that Chris, an assistant manager here seems to have a typical, shitty retail attitude. E.g.: he denies simple customer requests out of hand. I'll be going to Native New Yorker for wings from now on.,2012-10-15,il4Cs5b2x-6dl5VXw1Z7lQ

Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA,The weird old Asian lady needs to go. I've never seen an employee so enthusiastically ignore a patron that the owner had to tell her to quit playing with her point of sale terminal and greet the damn customer. After grudgingly taking our order and asking us the same questions over and over, she stood around playing with her pen like she was trying to solve a Rubik's Cube and basically wasting her boss's money.,2013-04-19,il4Cs5b2x-6dl5VXw1Z7lQ
