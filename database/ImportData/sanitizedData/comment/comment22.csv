L2c-qKZWumCmOCR-dqBLrg,I believe the 8th Saint is whomever created the Cheese Curds at Seven Saints, a trendy, slider-burger bar in Champaign, IL. They are hand-made, beer-battered curds, stuffed with oozing, white cheddar cheese & the best ones I've ever had! These giant, marshmallow-shaped curds will send your diet to hell in a hand basket, but they taste like they were sent down from heaven!,2014-09-12,tOTplIk838ZR1w1huTdX_Q,

K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg,I was wicked-crazy over the unlimited gelato bar at the Wicked Spoon Buffet in The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. Fashioned like a mini ice cream parlor, there are a rainbow of wicked-cool flavors to splurge on that are hand-dipped by a server & scooped out into cute, lil ramekins. Try 'em all, it's well worth the wicked cost of admission alone!,2014-10-29,tOTplIk838ZR1w1huTdX_Q,
-fiUXzkxRfbHY9TKWwuptw,When drinking at Destihl (pronounced ""distill"") Restaurant & Brew Works, a trendy, microbrewery\/gastropub in Champaign, IL, you must order their city-namesake craft brew aka the Champaign Blonde Ale, 4.9% ABV. It's a light\/crisp, golden lager brewed on site, their Bud Light. This signature, golden ale will satisfy even those with champagne-taste on a beer budget & is my #1 draft pick of all their craft brews!,2014-09-16,tOTplIk838ZR1w1huTdX_Q,
97TVQZZo_2nMDTeWvqfXXg,Stop & cool off with a cup o'premium gelato at Ciao Ciao Cafe & Bar when you're out holiday shoppin' in The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. This centrally-located gelato stand sells a gemload of yummy flavors. $8 gets you 2 flavors in 1 small cup with a complimentary, cute wafer cookie. For a taste like ""strawberries & creme,"" Tahitian Vanilla & Very Strawberry are my gemmy picks! Get those & a bottle o'Pellegrino & you'll wanna shop til ya drop!,2014-11-26,tOTplIk838ZR1w1huTdX_Q,
5bTjUBhGbild5tuzfAmIJg,I admit, I may have the patience of a rattlesnake but waiting for 30 min to get 9 waters, coffee & someone to take breakfast orders in a dead place could test even the likes of Mother Teresa. Do yourself & your sanity a favor & DON'T ever eat @Denny's in Champaign, IL. FYI: NOT my idea to eat here but confirmed why I just say NO to Denny's! Slowest service EVER: 2 hrs of pure dining torture for nasty coffee & inedible eggs! If Denny's is ""America's Diner,"" we have a national crisis on our hands!,2014-09-10,tOTplIk838ZR1w1huTdX_Q,
c2uAqJ2REpLMCZO2jxdi9w,Counting carbs or calories, then eat like a caveman today on National Cheeseburger Day & get your burger Paleo-style aka lettuce-wrapped at Five Guys, one of my fave, fast-casual burger & fry chains. Dress it up with all the gemlicious, free toppings ya want (sautéed shrooms & green peppers, grilled onions, fresh jalepeno peppers, pickles, tomatoes, etc.) & you won't even miss the bun! I think these Guys make one of the tastiest, tightest, best, lettuce-wrapped burgers in the biz!,2014-09-18,tOTplIk838ZR1w1huTdX_Q,
c2uAqJ2REpLMCZO2jxdi9w,If ya don't want to eat a whole bushel of fries in one sitting but still want to sava the flava of Five Guy's mouth-watering, hand-cut fries, FYI these Guys now offer a small size fry, aka the Little Fry for $2.49. This is the smallest size & an actual individual portion, whereas the regular order is enough for 2+ people & the large is enough to feed a hungry family of 4! You still get a gemload of gemazing fries for your buck but without feeling like you just downed an entire potato farm!,2014-09-20,tOTplIk838ZR1w1huTdX_Q,

z7GAft_JrFNmAH5xbVeYSA,Flight was smooth however, the crew did a poor job of cleaning up the aircraft.  What I didn't like is we had taxied out and we're out there for about thirty minutes and we had to go back to the terminal to get more fuel because they didn't have enough fuel because they had to file a new flight plan because of weather in the area.  They knew about the weather before and they didn't do anything about it.  It was poor planning on there part to waste fuel.,2014-07-06,4Z70lDXnO5SskT6neJ8hNw,

9p-cpmHaga-EXyc6ZzYCcQ,@ Donna E.  As a gay guy who goes to the Rabbit several times a week you're out of your mind. It's an extremely welcoming bar to everyone - and I mean EVERYONE.  If you get into other Vegas bars with broken out-of-state IDs more power to you. But they followed the law. And they were not rude to you nor did they use the language you claim. They are welcoming people - the owners and their employees.  It's my favorite bar in town.  Don't be angry then make untrue claims because of it. Not fair.,2013-07-20,-9tvXZauwIIpyy9J-moV6A,

CBb7z-MTbkzBvsUHBDqxEg,I am baffled by the lack of customer service.  Restaurants are a food\/customer oriented business.  We were given a number and was informed it would be a 30-35 minute wait.  We checked back in with the host after 25 minutes and was informed that they've stopped serving.  Why an establishment would say the wait is 30 -35 minutes and not offer service is baffling.  If you want to waste your time waiting for a table, this place is for you.  Otherwise, I'd recommend a Mcdonald's.,2013-09-23,14G2l4KkdHN2aalfaoRqrA,

We booked online on their website weeks in advance, they charged my credit card in full before our arrival (which is fine) however they made a ""mistake"" and gave our room away. We did not get the room we paid for and there was no empathy or refund. Stay at the new Grand if you want to stay downtown Vegas.

They hide in the back when their fans are in the store except when theyre filming; at which time they have the fans ushered back outside. The merchandise in the very small store (mostly stocked with Chumlee souvenirs) is ridiculously overpriced. When my husband told an employee he was disappointed, the reply he got was ""Well it's like sex. Not everyone enjoys it."" When the 15 mins of fame is over, I hope their fans show these wannabes the same courtesy,2013-10-11,cP0PFuZPGkl9h6xFcdIEBQ,

I was told TeamFord inspected the vehicle and that it was in top shape BUT another dealership mechanic second opinion just told me that red ""stop squeak"" fluid was applied to the rear brakes.  Turns out the rear brakes need immediate replacement (2mm pads left) It also turns out that the tires are worn down to below 4\/32, and 30K service due, and engine decarb needed, and cabin air filter was recommended for replacement a year ago.,2016-02-05,C9QPC4Qs1tIhHUeeLYXfig,

Took my Shetland Birkenstocks, a discontinued style, to get them repaired ($118).I had to return twice to the store. The top of the shoe had been ""repaired"" and stretched so tight that it was now rubbing against the top of my toes. The shoe seam looked like black tar had been used to put it together. My shoes were ruined, and I couldn't wear them. Deplorable repair and customer service.,2014-07-24,RYMeb_awdnR0t9-Mcn5B5g,

Pasta was also delicious, creamy and spot on flavor. And huge portions so I am taking a lot home to eat tomorrow.

DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,my new favorite restaurant of all time. I had the greatest dinner of my life. the fresh portabello mushrooms were amazing in the homemade pasta. the filet migon was out of this world! easily the best meal of my life,2012-10-20,BU4upf9mXlACVYf-Tr7qJQ,
DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,All the top chefs in Vegas are missing a key ingredient, homemade ingredients from a chef\/owner who personally makes or oversees your meal! The pasta is made fresh and is phenomenal but you must also have the Veal Reale, superb! Our server, Ann was extremely knowledgable and attentive! Nothing about this place is ordinary, all was outstanding! Highly recommend having an enjoyable dinner at Ferraros!,2013-04-28,je_BZaIFsYPYJkZcBYHxRQ,

fbaPMUfgjNk2ar7YpuPueQ,Came for Friday the 13th tattoos!! my friends tattoos turned out great, but I feel like mine's could've been a lot better. There are lots of differences, curvy lines aren't curvy, straight lines aren't straight. This is my first tattoo so I'm not sure if this is how it works out or if people are just telling me to comfort me a little, but I'm really hoping it thins out because the dagger keeps getting mistaken for a wand and I hope it just gets 10x more sharp and visible.
