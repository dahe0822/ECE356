n62dcL1e8BQA1_kUEYrldQ,My tip is I would not recommend anybody to be treated so badly by a business because my grandchildren were cheated out of their once a month special meal because the restaurant couldn't provide them the food the way they ordered it & then wouldn't even give them the refund of their hard-earned money. They should be ashamed of themselves.. basically being thieves & stealing money from my daughter & food out of my grandchildren's mouths. Because instead of that special meal they got pb&j 4 dinner.,2017-09-15,wH3XEKS1yamHSbAwAVZ2oQ,
n62dcL1e8BQA1_kUEYrldQ,Go some where else where they treat you with respect, don't lie, provide the food the way you confirmed it would be, and not charge you for getting nothing.  Oops, but they will call the cops on you and this your order away....oh and then offer to get it back out of the trash for you. Until the policeman tells him he will get arrested if he does. Makes ya think, how many times do they take stuff out of the trash when no one is looking then?,2017-09-15,wH3XEKS1yamHSbAwAVZ2oQ,

4VPjBVJKcxDpr00OMwxSww,if u get tacos get them in flour tortia.,2013-02-23,WyJem4y8g5ZpZ0umAHIicQ,
4VPjBVJKcxDpr00OMwxSww,So i just found out if u buy a pound of carne asada it cheaper then buy by taco. For example. 10 tacos is like 20 bucks. Which is less then 1\/2 a pound of meat. If u get two pounds it comes out to 24 bucks. The meat is still cooked and u still get everything u would if u asked for tacos. The difference is u have to make the tacos ur self. So u end up paying so much more just to have them put the meat on the torrtia. Hope this helps.,2013-06-05,WyJem4y8g5ZpZ0umAHIicQ,

I asked diagnosing for what? He replied to find out what the problem is. When I clearly stated the muffler broke which is why I needed a replacement. He then responded well I need to diagnose it because idk what year make and model it is and that's how we can give a quote. Like I couldn't tell him. What a joke,2013-07-12,arkwAg_Mm-kW-cUDkR915w,

We ordered the kung Pao beef not realizing it was breaded and fried instead of sauteed. We really didn't care for it and called to order something else. While it was our error they kindly took our new order and delivered it free. The volcano beef is amazing and they have always made sure we enjoy our meal, whether it was delivered or we have dined there. You can't go wrong,2013-04-29,dJYG63NNqFOfKj7wXTIoVQ,

Qe9LBkscg4oxrNcx-ypdqg,Not a great place to work. The managers (IF they can be called that) are unprofessional, unqualified and not able to so the job. Brenda is the head manager, she is good a making 'honey do Lisa's, but does not help in picking up the slack. Maria, can not handle the restaurant when there is more than 5 tables seated at any given time. She freaks out and wonders around the restaurant like a chicken with its head cut off...not doing anything. Jessica the night manager is a brain dead waste of life.,2017-08-03,xIM-J3IKgvHFXaCLpQhp-A,

I'd still sit in the bar area to get as far away from her as possible though!!! Management loves her for some reason and won't get rid of her.

Especially if he sees you wearing a Los Angeles Kings or Dodgers hat on, he'll call you a gangster or something else completely uncalled for. I've gone to other restaurants and have NEVER been treated as reprehensible as this guy does. He would be fired if it wasn't for the fact that the manager is his wife.

oVK04PF6eMlC9ZYjV1Lgqg,This dealership signed me into my 2007 Nissan xterra in January 2011 when nobody else would help since I had bad credit. So sales\/financing is great.

That was awesome. So all in all, great place! Thanks for everything!!,2014-07-23,IXE82-r50AILEr94TXRhvw,

I lost over $1000.00 in a very short time by changing to this outfit, even though I was promised my pay would at least match the shop I left. I learned a good lesson. I trusted them,and got burned. I guess hard work and honesty just wasn't what they wanted??? I could say alot more,but I think my point is made.,2016-07-12,hfhWLxssJEe5JekmlQJLcw,

Aoy8tyaIqgAihjU1Vwh6rQ,I have been to this thrift store numerous times, since I moved to the north Mesa area about a year ago. While I'm sure the Children's home is wonderful, the prices at the thrift store\/boutique are outrageous! Because of the ridiculous prices (specifically home goods, decor, furniture) at both the boutique and store, the store is packed and rarely moves merchandise off of the floor while 90% of their donated items sit outside rotting in the elements.,2016-03-30,8HDxprzFlZnHNVIGMVFUDA,

wDEDzNJjgWt5lSoheXHxaQ,This place is great but for the one reviewer complaining about DUI's well, use your common sense. This bar is on Main St. so there's no surprise that there is cops roaming the roads especially on Friday and Saturday nights. If you plan on drinking, get a DD. Simple as that, this bar also has a service where if your too drunk to drive and you didn't bring a sober friend, they have an employee who will drive you home.

I guess I'm not the first to write a bad review about this. But being moved every time when you're bowling slot is up and getting on the list again is very inconvenient and definitely not worth it for the money. No one has time to sit around and wait for 2 hours to bowl? Cosmic bowling is a better option. Bring business to a better place!,2014-12-28,jYryzzqScgqmPaHkOxuZRw,

5CeizAHfOQJOI6sSh0kJmw,Keep walking when you see their place. Trust the negative reviews that you see online. Otherwise, my tip is simply Have as low of expectations as humanly possible, expect to be given the wrong food, not be given food that you ordered and over paid for (their food isn't cheap), the food you do get is old, moldy, tastes bad, and is of really poor quality (hardly the best of Italy...I've been there), and expect to be treated like garbage if you dare to ask for any service or help.,2017-04-09,U5zT8pvUsl32TJlu95td5w,

DVvPQv1t08kusnnoMVhW-g,Be careful some of the waitresses are nice and others are very bitchy. My boyfriend was sending a text to his friend to meet up with us and one waitress flipped out saying he was taking her picture. He offered to show her his phone and she would not even let him. Everyone then proceeded to stare at us. It was really embarrassing especially since wasn't even taking a picture. Definitely would not recommend this bar to anyone,2013-11-30,5nKI1Uhzu4LqesNPwIwKxA,

DVvPQv1t08kusnnoMVhW-g,Don't go here and sit at the tables expecting quick service.  The bar is fast and attentive but the waitress working nights has a severe attitude problem.  She overcharged a friend of mine here a few weeks ago so he took it out of her tip. We're here again and she will not even come to our table even though the other five of us still tipped her 20%. After she saw his tip she walked by our table the rest of the night mumbling curse words.,2014-08-08,LXr4Cl7u886e7b7dfPY74Q,

-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA,Really wanted to love it. We love the Mission. It's certainly different. But the filet was a filet over sweet corn-nothing special. Fingerling smashed potatoes were too heavy with cheese & basil, very little potato in it. Duck confit, for a sharing plate was tasty.

PsTzoIERiCjq6QHrOnk2Lg,Looking forward to our second honeymoon at this highly praised resort.  Husband booked 2 months in advance and even upgraded to a king bed suite.  When we arrived, they gave us two full beds in a little room that look like Motel 6 for $500\/ night and refused to give us any bigger bed.  It completely shattered my romantic vison of a dream vacation and leave me a bad impression of Arizona.

aZ__2-Tm1urpbxF0eQ_gWg,The best toppings of any yogurt place I've been to in AZ. Yogurt selections are top notch (Pom rasp, cheesecake, peanut butter, etc...).  The toppings include mochi, boba, fresh berries, variety of toasted nuts and hot dressings like butter pecan. It helps that the proprietor is a down to earth all around cool guy.

a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g,Just stopped in tonight with my boyfriend. We were both really hungry and I read good reviews and keep seeing commercials on tv so I thought we should try it out. Upon entering, we both noticed how fancy it was, but the menu looked like a Fast food combo menu and not to fancy. The food was very bland and not even worth taking to go. My boyfriend is always willing to eat anything, but hated his food. Service was slow as well and there wasn't many people there. Would not recommend,2013-09-19,IhbfHxnvrwB2SHXK4buM7Q,

1heHNQIZiHL23rUsVhOmWQ,Been living here two years.  Nice place but get ready for enter increases every lease renewal.  My rent increased in 22 months from 860 to 1030 for a one bedroom!  Keep in mind that the maintenance staff is rude and there is never any parking.  Appliances are old and units are dirty, overpriced.,2012-11-08,Zovx6yFw6jjFHsigABepxQ,
Pa1k4iQfglrG6sTcDSKSQw,I have been searching for a 2013 wrangler sport and had bad experiences at air park and Earnhardt.  I went to Larry h miller in the 4 th and the staff was very friendly and professional.  I did not feel pressured and we were able to come to a very fair deal.  I would recommend them highly especially since they are the only  non commission sales center around, plus avondale has the lowest tax rate in the valley.  Bring cash and sell your car yourself, always better results.,2013-07-05,Zovx6yFw6jjFHsigABepxQ,
JT7cr4C-_ZjjxilGXVrpIA,Ordered a sandwich for takeout and the menu says 7.50 and when u went to pick it up it was supposedly 8.50.

On top of that the fees had added up to 5 grand so the wrangler was now 28500!  Disorganized and at times rude, what a waste of time.,2013-07-02,Zovx6yFw6jjFHsigABepxQ,

I learned more about my vehicle's warranty from him then my actual sales person. ( not talking about them ) on my last maintenance service appointment I had to leave my car. But Tim set me up with a rental so I wouldn't be left without transportation, and the cool part! It was part of my vehicle care plan. Which I also did didn't know about either.

The only thing I recommend is not to board the hot air balloon first because then you will be under the flames and it will be a burning sensation through out the whole ride. The take off was really smooth and landing was just a little rough. After everything. They open up tables and serve you breakfast with champagne. It's not all that but the champagne makes up for it. It is definitely and once in a life time experience!!!!!,2013-06-18,TAFBRZPvRnAnLUGHq2j3Fg,

mTIcH7nqFdH6GauNBohkzQ,Terrible. The female barber was hesitant on what I asked for (it was a basic haircut). Results were poor. Worse part was, it was a ten dollar haircut. I gave her a 20. Before getting my change, I handed her two dollars for tip. As I counted my change, she thanked me for coming, put her hand on my back and guided me out the door. I thought strange for her to want me out so quickly. When I counted my change, I received 8 dollars back instead of 10. She helped herself to another two dollar tip!,2016-01-08,PjjTRs-xY6xnhtKAaj5E4w,

But when not only you, but other tables around you are talking about dining an dashing because they aren't being acknowledged by staff, thats horrible. I ordered tea, took 2 sips, asked to exchange for lemonade. I got water and was still charged,2014-08-17,QjLTB-3G5M4SZHHB58wB2g,

Lik I mentioned, older setup.  However,  they open at 5 a.m. and close 11 p.m. and when it's summer in Arizona its nice to do your laundry at 5 a.m.  The washers are little bit deeper than the other laundromats in the area so I actually was able to  do   three loads in two loads and it only cost me $4 or $2 each load.

Took them an hour to reassemble the car (should have been 15 min max).  At the next place they called me to inspect the car... it seems Sun Devil did not like my departure as their tech DELIBERATELY damaged the parts.  With my own eyes I saw the damage on both wheels.

Vay9xHwcvu7VRZOddBgn-A,It was my very first trip to Boulder City and I saw this place in the historic district. They had a counter space since I came by myself. The people who sat on either side of me were very social and we had a great conversation. The waitresses are on top of it, the customer service was better than I expected and I was motivated to give a generous tip. I got the godfather burrito and they started me with a big, homemade cinnamon roll that rocked. I recommend this place for anyone,2014-10-12,kYfeML4OskmIe9f9maebkw,

BZdpKOUmFOR1mrMJ8sZgxw,You can't go wrong with the $2.99 breakfast special.  It includes lots of food (toast, bacon, eggs, potatoes,  etc) and is available every morning.  We've gotten breakfast for $2.99 as late as 11am. Also, they have tasty big juicy burgers.  It has a very casual neighborhood casino vibe. You order at counter & then go sit down and wait for your food. 4 stars out of 5.,2013-05-28,Syv4SqZBxmQakyyrWC7XfA,
wuQDMDlqM17jQNo0lYQZ7g,This place is uniquely charming. There is a cute patio in the back, full of character,  plants, flowers,  trees, paintings, and figurines,  etc. The pillow talk drink was sweet and refreshing (It was $8.00).
