i7_JPit-2kAbtRTLkic2jA,Went for dinner here for my birthday and was not disappointed. Oysters were amazing and came with a nice assortment of sauces and minionettes on the side. We shared four appetizers. Tuna tartare and oyster po'boys were very tasty and would definitely order them again. Smoked salmon and crab cake appetizer was standard, but definitely tasty. Cocktails were delicious. A little pricey but the location is very tucked away which is nice, i Would recommend this place.,2013-05-29,9DCpRiC2ABDhh5IF7JRMJw

u4sTiCzVeIHZY8OlaL346Q,The hanger steak is definitely your best option. The small plates are perfectly fine to fill you up. There is no need to go large. The flank steak is also very tender but not as good as the hanger. Stay away from the ribeye. It was dry and leathery in texture. Almost inedible on a sandwich.,2014-11-13,pwpKFY_WRFddFj7B_w578w

BpqggO7klU9Ky6WnVin1rg,the line system had changed. Now you are expected to wait behind ropes at the BOTTOM of the stairs! No misting system to keep you cool! After about 35-45 minutes waiting, when it is finally your turn you are told that you have to climb ALL 8+ flights of stairs at once! That's completely insane! Especially in the AZ heat! Plus while you are in line at the bottom, if you need to leave the line to get water ( which is inevitable ) you and your group have to go back to the end of the line!,2013-08-08,f6OoHlzWcuMSdfY2Qa2t7w

BpqggO7klU9Ky6WnVin1rg,Don't want to spend an arm and a leg on food in the park? Wet n Wild specifically disallows customers to bring food into the park *unless* you have health reasons to need special food. We packed a bunch of sandwiches and planned on telling the front security people we had diabetes. Well, we didn't even have to because they didn't care about the food.

BpqggO7klU9Ky6WnVin1rg,I was looking forward to relaxing in the lazy river all summer! As an adult that is one of the few attractions to make it fun\/relaxing. Unfortunately they turned the lazy river into a kids Attraction where you get buckets of water dumped on your head every few feet and kids can stand on side lines and shoot you in the face with high powered squirt guns. So disappointing!!! One bonus is the bar. Saving grace to at least be able to drink cold beer while the kids go wild!,2015-06-02,NpHj5E2qkX9DS4jbXf-s6A

nzgmxdQWDQnsub2SwZH3aQ,My fav restaurant in Charlotte. Unfortunateky our last experience not so good.  We were getting ready for a nice dinner when two wman with three small kids came in all under four.  Wow with a screamer.  The kind like fingernails to the chalkboard.   Kids that little don't belong in this place.  What happened to parents disciplining their children?  You can't go out for a peaceful dinner anymore!  Waitress first night on job but she was excellent.  Thanks Ashley!,2013-04-28,EUuuakRx1aXc3xpOtewVQA

y9E00yAbEQjCamSyIs7HjQ,The front desk staff is highly unprofessional and seemingly unorganized. I understand it is a learning environment, but being a former student in a trade school, there is a level of professionalism that needs to be upheld. The front desk is the face of most places and it forms a first impression. Unfortunately, due to the front desk staff, I was not pleased and frankly no longer excited for my massage.

UCJpL9VFk3g1B2gjRlLy_g,I've been here plenty of times. The only reason is because there is no ""classy"" place in Robinson to take clients. I can't take it anymore. It is a 50\/50 chance on if the food is good or terrible. Tonight I went and my steak was awful. I asked the guys I was with and they said the same thing. I can't spend $300 plus anymore on crap. I'm done.,2013-06-25,0mZqOUrzkTzK_IgVow_Dhg

ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,My husband and I showed up at 255 pm, the lady told us to look at the menu and let her know when we were ready to order. We ordered at 301pm and she literally pulled the lunch menu away from the front of the register...we were one minute late and paid more for our meals. Really? She couldn't have given us the lunch menu price or warned us when we walked in that we were 5 minutes away from paying 30% more for our meals over one minute.

wc2u2JM4Fx2smNwuIYxDzg,Empanadas were good but for the size (a little too small for me) and the price ($8 for only four) definitively not a good deal. My daughter ordered the kids meal (chicken tenders and fries) but the fries were way to over seasoned. My wife ordered the ribeye with roasted potatoes. Everything tasted good but she had the impression that the potatoes were at least a day old....finally, our waiter was very nice but the service was very slow....I don't think we will be coming back any time soon.,2013-06-28,1im4d6E7N9arAiYIjOAnqA

Gj9BJ_xczNkkLZVI0FBguA,Sugar amounts in the Iced Coffee vary greatly: if you ask for the regular amount, it can be too little, and if you ask for extra sugar, it can be like drinking from a glucose drip. Not that I do, but it might be an idea to carry sugar packets, and then, when necessary, up the dosage, because once there's too much sugar, there's nothing you can do (without a chemistry set).,2014-11-07,_dFLzthtUihLYWQABi7sgQ

My meal wasn't bad...but it wasn't good.

BKTomIwe9BHLWBJUXQ95xA,Best pizza I had in a while. The cheese was incredibly delicious and so was the garlic sauce . We had a white pizza.

You only get one. And the large pizza its actually a medium elsewhere.,2013-09-27,G-1w8kzBvC4XBme7i-7VDw

Looks like a nice place from the outside mainly because of its location at Dana Park. Don't let this fool you. Silverware was dirty- food was bland and not fresh at all. Probably the worst seafood I've ever had - not to mention a burnt baked potatoe, which was not cheap considering the atmosphere and quality of food. Nothing ordered was close to tasty.

tGyHEqd7SL8CRhVabGiHkg,As a former dancer to this place I wouldn't even recommend this place to anyone, the management is rude af, unprofessional, and cater to drama. The girls are dirty with exception of like 2-3 girls, the new management over charges the girls to work in a place with 0 customers over half of the time. I use to love this place but it has gone down hill very fast. I wouldn't advise going here if you want to have a good experience in a strip club.,2017-05-03,7rJls0VpcO5Ln1eqbwIpiw

For $3 my only complaint is that the cup is very small, only because I want more of this magical drink! My friend got a mocha and they nailed the balance of the sweetness. Perfect.

The food was very bland and the service mediocre ( of course I'd be upset too if I were making no money). Someone needs to tell the chef about seasoning. Being a chef myself I makes me angry when I taste bland food. SALT!!! Use it! The restaurant was clean probably due to the lack of business. The servers were standing in place sight shoving their faces with food. Not very appetizing.,2013-05-12,E4URUclX7pGQTLFdVzan4w

Not just that, but the cleaning i receive is far superior to any that I have received at any dental office.  I am so glad hygienist like Georgia have branched out their own to offer personalized hygienist services.   The paraffin hand treatment, massage chair and zen atmosphere make what could be a chore and unpleasant as the most enjoyable service.,2015-02-03,jDwT1ekJS0UcEGfGHaWeCg

8H04rqNNh_7Vr9ZAFB4Naw,Don't stay here. Worst vacation ever. We did not get any rest. They are doing construction and they start at the crack of dawn. And in Las Vegas that is pretty damn early.  I should have suspected something when in the check in line there were other people requesting room changes and EARLY checkouts because of the noise.

Crab Louis salad was great, but next time I will ask for HALF the amount of dressing or have it put on the side. The mashed potatoes had a lot of butter in them -- I would ask for them to go easy.  Somebody there really likes to load on the cooking fats!  Husband said green beans tasted strange.  I would go again but ask for less butter & mayo\/dressing on things.

The blue tee was recommended by the starter, which we discovered was a bit much for us. The ranger (Bob) met us on the course, very friendly guy who gave us a better overview of the course. He recommended we try the blended tees, which we did. This was one of the better tips we received. We played in about 4 hrs, never rushed at a good pace.,2014-02-12,8nr_kSnf9CKIcbIFaV0mfQ

ac3laXcJnclYZAO65XAcmA,What a disappointment.  Things started out great. Got seated quickly. Menu looked great. Drink order taken promptly by host. And then.....NOTHING. Waiters and waitresses ignored us as they busily took other tables' orders or cleaned counters. Attempts to make eye contact didn't work. Friendly smiles and waves to wait staff didn't work. NO ONE wanted to take our order. Over 20 min waiting to place an order (on a not so busy morning) we paid for our cup of coffee and left. What a waste.,2017-05-12,kKHiQ7Ie3WYMLIRDxPfC8Q

A bit frustrated, but needed to get it done.  Made an 8:30 appt, still waiting an hour later so thought I'd waste some time on Yelp. Wondering why it's taking so long for an oil change. . .

Xx5iZEAEJOcQi7zaYVC4sA,The owner invested a lot of time hyping up the place to us when we came in.  He claimed to be better than local favs Barro's and Grimaldi's.  Sorry, but no way!  The thin crispy crust was the best part of the pizza.  Everything above the crust lacked flavor.  Too bad because I was hoping to get the ""New York"" pizza they advertised on the windows.  Unfortunately, we won't be back but the beer was nice and cold though.,2014-05-19,CjAxSMHpB7-U9DJ1THiYrQ

zyh99Jf6y2wXKNrOvaXaAQ,Yes! The ac compressor went out in my ml350. I didn't realize that Tuffy could do big jobs like this or work on these kinds of cars, until I was referred by a friend with a Mercedes. I had previously taken to a specialty shop that tried to rip me off. Tuffy is family owned! They took the time to tell me what I needed and what I didn't! They charge a far price and worked with my difficult warranty company. They even dropped me off at work. I would highly recommend! Definitely be back!!,2013-05-18,elF4BBoh4fYqZu3EBxW98g

I saw none of this at this nail salon. As a matter of fact I paid $12 for a eyebrow wax I could've done myself!

After ordering the fried chicken and paying she advised me shortly after they were out of chicken. So while I was deciding since she would not let me cancel the order, she told me to hurry up because the kitchen is closing lol...freakin' hipsters smh.

My bf and me tried all of food here but we couldn't find anything is good to eat so we recommend you guys should go to another place to eat because $50 for each person is not worth it at all. One more thing, they have breakfast, lunch and dinner with different price but all of food is almost same so just go lunch to try for $27 if you guys don't trust my review more than over 2000 reviews here,2013-12-31,O33KOZazMErjdzZ9PQwP2w

As of right now my unit is in worse condition than ever! STAY AWAY,2016-11-07,N9Di5U16T43jygN-k7OfZA

CXsnrd0x-cobsI2KpeW4HA,Love it here. Everything's fresh always! Only tip I hv is if u order special salads like Spicy Korean Town u'll get a small paper bowl n b disappointed for the amount. If you're hungry, order salads from the regular menu. U can always tweak it w\/the server. My server tonight was accommodating. I ordered the Cobb Salad n instead of just romaine she let me hv half o it n arugula. Then, instead of the bacon, I got to choose two different sides so I chose hearts o palm and cucumbers. Mmmmmm,2017-07-06,zDKszv6zpuLsVhPFZLctXQ

svlXCnKihlQrgtczTk4SLQ,I'll begin with the awesome part of my experience: CANDIS. Warm, welcoming, informative of specials and how their consignment program works. The manager on duty can learn a LOT from Candis. The items were nice enough and the store well arranged, but the manager was curt, almost as if she couldn't be bothered. I was new to the location but not the name. And while checking out, she yells out Candis's name to draw attention to some display stand. Maam, customers first!

And my bangs (which I've never had before and finally got the guts to try) are slanted and uneven on the sides. It looks chopped. I came home SOBBING over how awful it looks.

hVLFDDA31wYm3Jjz3w74GA,I got the feeling that Mr Rob Duckworth only seems to care about income and not the employees. Being a previous resturant owner myself I recently noticed 6 employees in a small area on an empty shift that clearly needed far less. He obviously is taking advantage of the $2.13 an hr wage that N. Carolina has to offer. We left a generous tip which our server was extremely thankful but there's no way she could've made that much today with the lack of tables she might have had.,2014-01-05,EzDyYgv5bZB70szQMliHIA

Both times I went here when it was right down from Elevation Church I waited 15 minutes before anyone came up to ask me if I wanted a beer.  Some fatass guy sat on the couch texting or playing on his phone while I sat at the bar waiting to get served.  Beer was above temp, service sucked, place was uninviting.  Would not go back if this was the last craft beer store in NC,  I Hope you fail in the new spot, and oh yea, learn about beer, Peace!!,2015-09-15,JU29lvPmdz7ZECKxK9IsqQ

So take the one with other ingredients (likeMushrooms,Vegetables..). Wide choise of dishes. The place?much more a kind of fast food than a restaurant, but warm.  Potatoes? not so special cause they were flabby. Is that the original recipe? Maybe too much people to wait on. Cheese? Not melted down and tasty but gummy! Price good 4quantity.

Not much different from Home Depot and most of their inventory is imported, arriving on huge ships, so quality control is non-existent.

lKC4TcCzszmd-2Ak2GCH5A,Let down! Was my sons first haircut.  The salon itself is very cute!  However, the hairdressers are not kid friendly at all.  We were not greeted when we came in.  There was no enthusiasm from the girl that did my sons cut.  Zero customer service.  She looked like she hated her job.  Also was dressed quite inappropriately for a children's salon.  Cleavage is not necessary for that kind of environment.   It was no different from any other dry salon like a best cuts.,2014-04-16,rJTEz1zrXdUAQI7CjOpzKA

x61bpmE8QueV4F--VbqIxQ,Wow! I have read the posts that are less than excellent, and I cannot disagree more. Honestly, the people that have concerns need to talk to the owners (Mike in service or Michelle I. Sales or overall concerns).  These two people have a vested interest in assuring EACH and EVERY customer walks out ready and able to pass among a positive comment about the dealership to others.

We were told they would be on a plane here at 5:30 pm and they would deliver them to his location the same night. He had a tournament the following day at 9 a.m. No call\/no show. Called their missing baggage line only to be told they had no updates but they would call at 9 am. That doesn't help. We paid an additional $50 to bring them, now who knows where they are bc no one has answers. This is one of many screw ups with AA.,2013-09-01,nP08nNAtDFEm7L5qbiNMIg

Cgz5LfLohDjo1rmPL5l9Tg,Worst flight I've ever had. Writing it as I'm still sitting on the plane, still listening to the flight attendants talk about someone's hair, as they've talked about shallow stuff extremely loudly the entire trip. I had the volume full blast on my headphones and could still hear them clearly-makes for a very irritating flight with no sleep. Not to mention that I left on a weds with my carry on being an acceptable size, and coming home on Sunday, being forced to gate check it. Never again!!!!!!!!,2013-11-03,AD8Y0Ro0HNj6HB5WdQGsHQ

usm1DUwpkgEESkJCHXbuFA,2nd class citizen is right. I paid a thousand plus a month July thru August to end up being run out of the hotel. The hotel manager Bob is an assh**e, and the area manager David is an even bigger prick who never gets in contact with you. After a 3 1\/2 month stay my room was never cleaned.

UXXAzmuz2olKSpte9eF4Vw,My fabulous new Colombian neighborhood restaurant. Family owned with home cooked specialities a great atmosphere and huge selection of beer. A bar with more than a touch of class. Moncho's has erased all traces of the former occupant. Except the fireplace. They even made me a special chicken dish not on the menu.

8dK-8e006F_it5bNxTVlaQ,One of our favorites for BBQ.  I like both the pulled pork and the beef brisket.  There is eight sauces ranging from mild to very spicy.  Their beans are good but a little to spicy for me. Most of the dinners come with two sides and corn muffin, which really good only wish they would serve the muffin warm or fresh from the oven, also wouldn't mind seeing that you can order more muffins it always seems to be the first thing to go.,2014-03-24,9WPbBpZRntfkh0OagG0C2A

E3m-twP4h0-qzakUTBYDpw,If you are considering doing the Rock N Roll Half Marathon Vegas, you will have a blast. Stick with  the half marathon, since the full marathon takes you to ugly parts of Vegas. I did the inaugural  and the 2016 race. Run the strip at night and see all the great attractions up close. Every mile has entertainment.  This is one of the best Rock N Roll Marathons that I have ran. FYI: if you don't like to wait in stalls, this run isn't for you.

MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw,The place has a rustic feel similar to the remote run-down Mexican Taco place.  The atmosphere resembles more of mixed variety of various cultures close to a melting pot of Korean, American, Mexican, and Italian cuisines. The background wood and distracting interior was atrocious to the point that I lost my appetite especially with bamboo in the back of the restaurant. It is distasteful and I do not plan on coming back to this establishment ever. The service is mediocre with their rudeness.,2014-06-01,NLi-FolKoFVonkbdWgI4iw
aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,Excellent food and definitely check out the Beef Sushi that comes from combo sets. Their Skirtmeat combo is a must get item.

5lTcS8XNX5oGvtCToJgPDg,NEVER use these guys. My realtor basically crammed them down my throat (it seemed suspicious to me, like they were giving him some kind of kickback for it) and going through with it was the worst thing I've ever done.

tPHYc6rKiA0zrXOcLaX7kQ,Interesting items but terribly disorganized. We were looking for a table-which we found. I had to contact John the owner 3 times via phone in order to confirm that someone would be there (I actually showed up twice during their very limited open hours and the door was locked). The employee was unable to take credit cards as advertised and did not have the enough change for a cash payment. This is the most frustrating unprofessional interaction I've had in a long time.

dDLRhywKVjnSIFe4H5tu_w,Has good food!!! Personally think the menu is too big for one short ordered cook to handle. Something is always late or wrong. Everytime that I go there is always only one waitress on. Not enough for the amount of business that goes in. For ex. There are 31 guests in the diner right now for one girl & one cook. Good food is you like to wait & have to hope it will be right. It's too bad there isn't another place to go in the area.,2013-05-10,73mPy0pv3grD5uq_6oRGzQ

MTCyh5VqkKp1LIvfeI-TTg,Went on a Wednesday night with my girlfriend, who had been salivating over the menu for months. We ordered dirty martinis that came out almost straight vodka, which was really disappointing. The pork belly - kopitas were okay. They had a sourness to them that I attributed to the apple. The duck quesadillas were a huge disappointment. The duck was way overcooked and the naan bread was almost burnt. Overall we gave it a 6 out of 10, and probably won't go back.,2013-09-13,RXcSx-Ve4D9viVyXfPM0iw

I've come to this location for many years but have never seen it this bad! The malaysian fried rice tasted and smelt funny so did the pad thai, & u guessed it! It was cold!

y2U-26RNB06y9q8cX8SaMg,Well I actually liked this restaurant until they charged as much for hot water as they do for the beverage. If you want to make money, don't find petty ways to charge clients extra without even requesting them first. I have dined at quite a few high end middle eastern establishments. However, none have been this petty. Even the most modest. Not a pleasant feeling to leave an establishment with.,2014-04-12,csPj0cC2zaMidb2rnjwe_A

YLPNiyf3rVKINhT1CvTeZw,I've been coming to Jerk King consistently since its inception for its friendly service and its hearty and well-priced food. I have to declare that the fried chicken here is hands-down one of the best in the city. For just $4, you get the heavenly experience of biting into two crispy, juicy, well-seasoned, tender pieces of chicken. You also get to watch as people after you start ordering the chicken too based on your expression alone!,2013-08-16,ttIye9qeDzYZZVMyjqq-RQ
YLPNiyf3rVKINhT1CvTeZw,Cheap & tasty.,2014-06-25,Foby92g4NzXb9WaHBUDMig
YLPNiyf3rVKINhT1CvTeZw,My favourite of the ""Jerk King"" locations, and not just because its down my street, they just do something special here. Its tiny, so there isn't much seating. If you're alone, or with a friend, and just plan on eating quickly, its okay for that, otherwise I recommend to go. The price is right for the amount of food you're getting, and the food is always delicious. Open late, so a great place to grab last minute dinner, or a pile of fried chicken after a night of drinking. Free coleslaw is boss!,2014-07-27,LEpqUYH1-X0tFz6DiDe8sw

Every time I have shopped in this store someone is constantly following you around bc they think you're going to steal something. I made a comment about the price mark up to a friend and the owner chose to get involved in my conversation and tell me I needed to go shop somewhere else.

nrrBpUG6MTAJrm1Mp5WcCA,Avoid this place. Its crawling with gangbangers and being served by ridiculous street trash bartenders who spend more time singing karaoke than making drink. Expect food that looks and tastes like it was prepared in a morgue, disgusting tap beer being poured out of dirty lines, and to be stabbed to death in the parking lot. The bathroom is absolutely foul and reeks of stale urine, the bar is sticky, their bottles are dusty, and like I said, the tap beer is disgusting. STAY AWAY,2013-10-28,MulVEhkqCJUDoJ_4x46ymg

H6UYKqj0iO_hvvlM76nh0A,I decided to try this place one more time. These poor kids have no help. The drive through was backed up so we came inside. Only 2 people working the whole place. None of them smile or seem to enjoy their job. I don't think I'd like my job either if there was no help and customers were always unhappy. The mean one yelled at the poor other girl who was trying to help us out because we came inside instead of waiting in drive through. Needless to say it took a half hour to get our order.

YakO7e9dxaYk5WrkNyRVFQ,There is a legal maximum charge that you can be charged for a non police ordered tow that is set in your city ordinance. In Phoenix,  for example, it is $105 and a $12 a day storage fee.  They CAN NOT charge you more than that.  I live in Laveen, AZ, which is a village in Phoenix,  and they tried to charge me $200 for the tow and $15 storage. I am a cop in Phoenix and had to call in other Officers who were on duty to have them comply with the law.  Do your homework,  they are bottom feeders.,2015-12-25,pWjBiv1UPLXPAtPUuf8IRw

tccSRPy8Azx5IrusUkaT9A,I moved in about a month ago and have had absolutely nothing to complain about. The place is well maintained, the amenities are a big plus, my apartment was in really good condition upon move-in, and my balcony view is amazing. The office staff is the best group of ladies when it came to assistance. From the second I walked in, to the day I got my keys and thereafter. I would recommend this place to anyone.

PnXZ1hVnTAOLS_3dVvDKaw,Number one if you buy a car from them  extreme amount of shipping costs and they lied to you for the next 2 of why the car's not here it will have 900 miles extra on it  with broken parts along with food in the passenger seat and Happy Meal toys on the floor so trust me if you're going to buy a car from them drive it home they are a scam and a rip off besides the fact that Chris the salesman will lie to you and Alex the owner will cuss you out when you're simply just calling to ask about  car,2016-06-05,nNPRqCsyrONGEqxzXkmlhw

88zCCPkPgtVLN9EHDivw1g,I feel as bad leavin a bad review because the people that work there are so nice and polite. I got a full set and a pedicure. My nails are all wonky and not filed straight. They weren't even buffed down at the end and are still rough on top. I had to refile them myself.  Both of my heels have scabs on them from where they were scraped raw. There were other parts that weren't even sanded at all!  My feet weren't that bad either. A good soaking and a washcloth could have cleaned them up. :(,2013-05-08,_PD9kIkhUnU8qRFtueZzlQ

yj8lfLr9fn9g_0nqHluLRQ,Nice club but I travel Internationally a lot. I liked the idea of putting my membership on hold for $10 a month.  But then they charge another $10 for a processing fee.  Then the processing few went to $25 for a $10 charge.   The last time, the processing fee was $45.00 for a $10 charge. That's 3 processing fee increases in less than 12 months.  That's crazy and unethical.  So that's when I quit the club.  I know so many others that have quit this club as well as several employees.,2016-04-15,7REcMKn_Iei5Z6f5ut7yAw

AIZ05Tv4rCwWQhsyTtrU1A,Please do not move here I warned you. The people living here carry guns and rob everyone.  From what I see constant flow of police and about 20 units robbed in a very short few months.  They hang out all day and get drunk and smoke weed.  Always a fight we thought we were cool with neighbors then found out we were being targeted.  The security people are rude the management people sucks.

The best part is many of the servings are very small, so you can try so many different dishes without getting too full.

I stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions with the attempt of their team to upgrade, only to receive a text within 20mins that my room was ready.  A different amount was offered to my colleague and I for the same upgraded room.,2015-02-07,BuSa9GIfXYrBxn2Z5pIj8A

0s6zVxOeApNbEwcs-JLjNw,If you are considering Choice Center, my tip is to instead seriously look into Spectrum Life Design (also known as Spectrum Education) also in Las Vegas. I attended Spectrum and had mostly positive experiences that have helped my life for the better. The two programs are similar, only Spectrum has a much smaller number of enrollees (so you get more individualized attention).  Also, Spectrum costs less than half of what Choice Center costs.,2017-11-24,ftGDlgr5zZZscz9iVJYhdQ

oM6TsEcgj4i9McivZnu5EA,Jenny was amazing. But DON'T get your nails done by the guy. You will waste a lot of money!!! Less than a week later every nail was badly lifting. The primer he used was crap. Not only that but a crack he fixed by just placing acrylic over snapped the nail three days later tearing my real nail. It bled pretty bad and hurt for days. The acrylic area by my cuticles was really rough too. Like it wasn't worth him filing it down. My nails looked like garbage a week later.,2013-09-15,sV2byruBDj6IXSyLI38yRA

Kg3BfZdGuMkM1LBgi1e79g,So far not so good.  The appointment was at 4.:00 PM and we were 15 minutes early.  Did the questionnaire and had the blood pressure done about 20 minutes after we got here. It has now been an 1 hour and 35 minutes and still no doctor. The staff is nice but that only goes so far.  If you can't see your patients in a timely manner you should do one of two things,  a: hire more staff or b: make less appointments.  Finally see the doctor and he's rude. I'd suggest going somewhere else.,2016-03-22,I66RdvP7MUxfWyJScTfIqA

Would have thought they would have drained and refilled my radiator but it looks like they only out coolant in my over flow tank. Also suggested to put in upper an lower hoses at an excessive cost for the part $80 when I can get it from auto zone for under $20.

I also love their sliced lamb so flavorful I don't think ill ever get any other meat on my Gyros. The photo is a pic of their Greek salad to go.,2013-09-15,3N9-Kk7kcyhLvBseaKPUeQ

However once i moved to Georgia two months after i bought my car the 500.00 maintenance agreement I bought, in which I specified that I'd need to use in another state, wasn't good in GA.  Simple fix right?!!! No... I have been jerked around from the receptionist, sales manger, finance manger, etc. (Sam and Nick).

Unprofessional and if anyone ever called me a #%^*%##^* he will need to check his ass because that's where I would shove that car.  I would advise the public to buy your car from someone who has respect not only to their customers but to themselves too.  After all without us, you won't get a paycheck.

The cooks inside their own kitchen looked like a Brazilian restaurant. I ordered a large carne asada fries and I gotta say $10 for them was well spent.

Z5lWNbjPpr8CqHN0NmfRsw,Andy is a wonderful beautician but she needs to work on customer service. I referred a good friend to her & she was a faithful weekly customer. One day she went to get her hair done an hour before the last wash & Andi would not take her. To make matters worse she didn't even have any customers. My experience with Andi was she kept charging me different price for the same hairstyle, and it was always more not less. I like the work she does but the poor customer service was enough to keep me away.,2015-11-27,kjlNF_YIpGulM385RTmavQ

CEzfPpWwtGWSpVZUAxRCvQ,Jean's a racist as was proven in her reviews left for other Chinese cabinet companies. How many cabinets did she install in a year?? Also out of my 116 reviews left of course there were 1 star experiences but at least I didn't leave 1 stars for the SAME TYPE OF BUSINESSES OVER AND OVER LIKE SHE DID nor address COLOR OR RACE. My 5 star reviews outweigh my 1 star reviews. Plus she was never a customer of Sunnys and already had one comment removed due to her racist tone.,2017-04-26,vU8eyqx5z-g8TVmgPvRfVQ

HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,We decided to go for breakfast. Food looked amazing. The food wasn't piping hot but still warm enough to eat. Chicken fried bacon plate gets a 3 out of 5. The gravy was good but the plate was just missing something. The maple bacon French toast sounded good and looked good but can up short with a 2.5 out of 5. I guess I just expected more from Guy. The service from the staff was good but our waiter was average.,2015-02-06,ahgR21QCcf3NWFTAAl2LNg

CMJqS9j_FB_lSgMhnl_NFQ,This place is in the industrial park away from the strip and is hard to see as you drive up to it. My recommendations? Taxi over, because it's easy to let time get away from you and get a little tipsy, because they stay open all night. Trust you GPS when it says ""your destination is on the right"". Set a phone alarm if you don't want to be there all night. I let time get away from me the last night I went.,2015-09-07,2Avi2EyzZaSBPX3_cA-uxw

ZZXLiDkBUdrasopHpLQxiQ,Was there earlier today. nice place, inside one of the old UofT buildings (junior room, univ college). no sign outside anywhere so u hav to ask ppl to direct you. Once in, its nice with a feel of old traditional study room: wooden floor, walls. The cafe is just a counter in a corner. I only had a chicken wrap with orange juice and those cost me $6.75... wouldnt say its cheap. Probably good for tea\/coffee n cookies... anyway, i ll go there again just for being so close to kings college circle.,2014-02-25,Jl2spJbqqF1a27MhviAbvQ
