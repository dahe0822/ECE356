K-VAzC7M63dP2JC5nwkxlA,Place is cluttered and disorganized, kind of dark too. The owner is a strange fellow. I was just looking around one day when he and some other customers were going off on some kids for not being Christian, you could tell they were really uncomfortable. I'm glad he didn't drag me into that conversation. Last I circled this was a comic book store, not a church. I won't be returning either, seems like everything gets picked over by his box customers and were left with the scraps.,2013-12-25,0o2vwqrv_25Iy4frcSGB2Q,

Isn't that his job?  Plus this place is so jammed packed full of stuff for someone like me who is disabled and visual impaired its very difficult to explore the place.

The cave room is tiny for $130 a night, but it does include a nice breakfast at the diner across the street. The cave room could use improvement, such as having a place to hang clothes. Yep, there is no closet, nor is there even a pole on which to hang clothes, so they obviously have no reason to provide hangers.

There are  9 sauces, + some specialty sauces that I don't know anything about.  The nine sauces are:  BBQ, Buffalo, Cheese, Honey Mustard, Ranch, Strip Sauce (House Sauce), Sweet Chili Sauce, Teriyaki, and Wasabi Cream.  They have a kids'' meal for $4.29.

0onIwbCKK8HRw1itKvbWng,I bought their free oil change card from a guy in uniform going door to door. Made sense since they opened 1\/2 mile down the road. Even with the free oil change coupon it was $70. Wtf? Took it there one more time presented my card and was told they do not honor those anymore. Even though it expires 6\/2014. I will never take my car there again. Never. As soon as you walk in the door you just get a feeling it's a sketchy place.

awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg,They added a new item called boui-roast combo of pan roast and boiubais, I thought the pan roast was way better. You get more added seafood like clam and muscles but they were gritty meaning some sand in it. And the flavor was just not as good as a pan roast.

hRQS8y-uG2kc8miWVYiLuQ,Jay, gave me the worst service, ever! He reached across a couple of our guests to serve drinks and when he finally got around to taking our dinner order, at his leisure. All of our drinks were empty, and that didn't seem to bother him either. And amidst him taking the time out of his busy schedule to take our order( with 3 other tables in the place), he proceeds to tap his hand on his crossed arms. One of our group mentioned that we must have pissed off the waiter.  Steaks, tough! That is all.,2014-03-24,4qT5ND7LAwUcN-t6_P0yDg,

awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg,Try the ""dirty"" Alaskan chowder! Mixture of white and red. Loaded with shrimp, crab, lobster, it's a bargain at $18.99.,2014-11-18,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg,Try the bull roast. Secret menu item. Combination of pan roast and bouillabaisse. Not as heavy and creamy with regular pan roast.,2016-02-01,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg,Alaskan chowder price used to be $18.99. Now it's $23.99! Still worth it since they load it with seafood, but not quite the bargain like it was before.,2016-10-17,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
7tNY4BYLA4laqWNV4IWGQg,The toppings are scant, and the crust towards the middle is very soggy and floppy. When I did the pizza fold, everything just slid right off. I've had my fair share of Neapolitan pizza all over NY and New Haven, and love thin crust pizza. Overall, the crust is a bit TOO elastic.,2014-04-21,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,Middle of the pack steakhouse in city full of great steakhouses. Complimentary duck fat fries a nice touch, but the caramel popcorn given after the meal was stale. Steak was okay.,2013-07-23,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

J4CATH00YZrq8Bne2S4_cw,Make no mistake about it, you are paying dearly for the name. American Angus Kobe ribeye was excellent, but small portion for the price. Stay away from the sauces for your steak. Lobster was simply prepared, but tender with plenty of meat.,2012-07-08,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
Az_60nNuh1FH8Ds8oasZjw,So much for a quiet getaway on Saturday night. Front desk said our room facing the mountain would be quiet vs. the Strip view. Nope, it's all night thumping to the same ass beat by the DJ. I'm fist pumping in my sleep.,2012-09-15,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw,This buffet isn't as popular nor a bargain anymore. $40 for weekend seafood lunch\/dinner is only worth it if you gorge on crab legs, seafood, prime rib, drink alcohol. Quality has declined - they offer those skinny half snow crab legs now.,2012-07-01,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog,Foie gras creme brÃ»lÃ©e was rich, creamy, decadent. But my favorite dish of the tasting menu was the 48 hour beef belly. A little bit of smokiness, sweetness, and marbling was oohhh sooo good.,2012-09-15,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw,This whole gourmet, overpriced burger craze is ridiculous. Salmon burger was ok. The restaurant, mainly bar area, smells like a wet rag.,2011-08-09,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

ty5KQYqYRxwXDG_e4pz-4w,Even with discount, not worth the money. You're better off spending more on a real Cirque du Soleil and comedy show. Or, just be drunk.,2011-11-27,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
td-NOo-k4xhfVmO5X92uAg,Located in a random strip mall. If you are unsure what to order, just ask. Order a variety, as dishes start to taste the same. Thumbs up.,2011-09-04,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

6Vyp-9i1jzwK_bvisuPJpQ,Lobster roll has good flavor and decent amount of meat, bun is buttered and toasted. Ask for free sample of Lobster ice cream (eehhhh).,2011-09-04,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A,I agree with the consensus for the most part - good dim sum, but spotty service. Prices are actually not too bad, but $1 for tea per person (ugh).,2012-07-01,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,Good ramen, but not as good as Monta -- they set the bar pretty high.,2013-01-08,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
OETh78qcgDltvHULowwhJg,For a high end steakhouse, they have the weakest, smallest, and dullest steak knives. They are more like butter knives!,2016-03-30,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
l_GV0hgEoTUf70uJVT0_hg,Long wait before and after sitting during peak hours, but worth it. Fresh, quality food but coffee is pretty weak. Corned beef hash and pancakes are on on point!,2014-01-19,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g,Every buffet has its pros and cons. If you're a Vegas buffet veteran, I don't think you'll see or eat anything out of the ordinary here. Lines are long now, because it's the new kid on the block.,2012-09-14,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g,4 hour wait according to their new ticket machine. Are you serious?! They essentially force you to pay the $20 expedited fee just to get in right away. What a rip off!!,2014-01-03,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g,Compared to when I first tried this buffet when it first opened 2 years ago, quality, selection, and presentation has gone downhill for sure. Still only worth the price if you load up on meat and seafood.,2014-01-20,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
--DdmeR16TRb3LsjG0ejrQ,Burger extravaganza last night was awesome. Plenty of burgers, dessert, and alcoholic beverages... and I got to meet Adam Richman. Thanks Misti and Yelp LV!,2012-11-03,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

1BrIPwRhJHOp6yBwjoRtgg,Decent ""gourmet"" donuts for the price. I'm used to paying $3-4 per gourmet donut in LA\/OC, and here it is $1.75. While good, the donuts aren't as light -- they are a bit heavier and dense. But still good. 4 stars.,2014-03-02,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
UT6L3b7Zll_nvRidijiDSA,Good, bubbly crust. But there's something about NY-style Secret Pizza in Cosmo that tastes better. $5.50 per slice, limited topping options.,2013-07-06,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
3GEEy7RP6e4bT4LAiWFMFQ,I've tried a lot of pizza places in Vegas, and this is my favorite thus far. The margherita is simple and well executed. A bit pricey at $17, so be sure to use the 15% off Yelp check-in.,2014-06-16,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
7sb2FYLS2sejZKxRYF9mtg,Top AYCE sushi spot based on quality of fish, fish to rice ratio, selection, and value. Not expecting stellar service, but the waiters for my table were miserable.,2017-01-17,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,Very heavy handed with the flat leaf parsley on some dishes, to the point where it just overpowers the entire dish. Had to scrape a lot off.,2013-11-30,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,The chargrilled wood flavor is great on steaks, but with some delicate protein like scallops there can be a bitter burnt aftertaste -- especially when used with a glaze with sugar. When we told them, they said ""the chef intended it to be that way."" Uh, no.,2013-11-30,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

ItqPtxnayraXSlBS0EMOgg,They didn't have any cookies for the free Yelp check in, so they hooked it up with a free apple ring. So good! If an apple pie and donut got busy together, you get an apple ring.,2016-12-20,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,Burgers are okay, the beef lacks flavor. In the world of celebrity burger joints, Gordon Ramsey takes the cake. Just a stone's throw away, Shake Shack will open late in the year - better beef and less expensive.,2014-07-06,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
OKZkEXzJt0XIamHRRTX-8g,Horrible. Avoid at all costs. Ordering system is disorganized and slow. We got stuff in the box we didn't order. They should show you the items before wrapping up the box. Everything we had was stale, flavorless, and dry. Cake boss? Cake weak sauce!,2014-04-21,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA,The crust isn't meant to be super crispy - everyone has gotten used to Pieology and all those other customized pizza joints. Neapolitan pizza has a slight chew and elasticity. High quality ingredients, hand-stretched dough, brick oven.,2014-07-06,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
HhVmDybpU7L50Kb5A0jXTg,Food is more ""in-yo-face"" style than substance... sorta just like Guy Fieri himself. Be prepared to open your wallet for bar food.,2014-06-17,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
6NFI8nSKod7qtxfsRUJpVw,Important to note that they serve ice cream, and not gelato - even though it's presented as such. Not rich and creamy, so be prepared to eat fast in the Vegas heat.,2014-07-06,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
1yWINuTOUBQj8ELqRNDOWA,Nice spot for some gelato and crepes. Super friendly and helpful staff. Parking can be a challenge in this plaza during peak hours.,2016-12-23,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
A4zLP5AyKEEHQr_dWEZKig,A hidden gem. Every dish was excellent! Octopus was one of the best I've had. Scallops were perfectly cooked. Wagyu skewer was super tender.,2017-09-03,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

ZOmf-3NN4Z59b2Fw6VAM7g,Okay breakfast spot. A bit overpriced. The housemade corned beef hash is same price as Grand Lux Cafe on the Strip, but smaller portion and not as much corned beef.,2017-03-12,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
FMnH5WIRLyexBYMBUUnDxQ,Good happy hour deals, but the regular menu is overpriced for average quality food. $30 for a seafood platter of 3 jumbo shrimp, 3 oysters, 1 small lobster claw. Not good value.,2017-11-07,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,The fried chicken was moist, juicy, flavorful. The skin wasn't as crispy as I had hoped. Not worth the $26 splurge for 4 pieces.,2017-11-07,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

0qet57CmMA5qUm6gPFUTpg,Save $1 off each slice with Total Rewards card. $5.99 to $6.99. Whole pies are in the $30 range.,2014-12-24,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw,My standards for chicken and rice is pretty high considering I've had the national dish in Singapore, I'm a big fan of Nong's Khao Man Gai in PDX and Savoy Chicken in Alhambra. The chicken and rice here is below average and disappointing overall.,2017-01-18,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,Same owners as Monta, but not as good. It's more expensive, and they only give you one measly piece of chashu. The spicy flavor overpowers the overall subtlety of the broth. Plus the scallions should be chopped up!,2016-12-23,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,Beef combo for two is plenty of food. High quality meat and great service. Side dishes are really good. It's a toss up between this place and Hobak for best KBBQ in Vegas.,2017-09-03,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
uW6UHfONAmm8QttPkbMewQ,Good, old school Hawaiian food. Seems better for dine in versus takeout. Pricier than some of the other newer Hawaiian spots in the area.,2017-01-17,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

XQETjKH84gxDrAiz2lH7Wg,First time trying the cereal milk soft serve and I really liked it because it wasn't overly sweet. Loved the corn flake crumble for added texture.,2017-01-18,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,
R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,The portions come in a giant bowl, you could share with two people if not terribly hungry. Udon is thick and chewy, so good!,2017-03-12,KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,

uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA,The food is very good and they make great drinks, but I have to disagree with the $$ rating.  We got 4 appetizers and two drink during happy hour and it cost $60.  A normal dinner could easily cost a normal persons entire weekly food budget.  Definitely would say this is a special night dinner.  The food is good but not worth what they are charging for it.  Just figure your spending $20 to have a stream running though the middle of the restaurant.,2013-02-28,oxQY2r3yNkEEhvVq6sU0Mg,

fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A,If you like really good food this is a place to visit!  The owners ran another one on the north side of town and now bring their great food to the south west, just be sure to MapQuest it first since it's an indirect route to get here.  The food is reasonable at $10-12 a plate.,2013-03-03,oxQY2r3yNkEEhvVq6sU0Mg,
20n09j__6xb7JX0xe9Oo9A,Just like any other grocery store, just 5-10% cheaper.  It's not worth driving across town for me, and if your spending $200-300 a month you might as well go to Costco.  If you live in the Henderson area then this should be you first place to shop.,2014-09-27,oxQY2r3yNkEEhvVq6sU0Mg,
OETh78qcgDltvHULowwhJg,The first time we went for the PB&J desert a month ago and it was fantastic.  Went again for a birthday desert and just wasn't as good as last time.  The berries weren't sweet, they had a bitter bite.  They also changed the crust and took away the sherbet side.  Very disappointed in the $11 desert.,2013-02-28,oxQY2r3yNkEEhvVq6sU0Mg,

ZRTKCVOqhcbuY1RyLwhvhQ,This is an upscale bar for the business class people that come to this hotel.  The signature cocktail is $15, other review say that it is worth it, which may be so when you make $30\/hour.  20 people at closing on a Thursday, so it is much better then most bars in the area.  If your in the area and want to have some good drinks in a classy bar surrounded by classy people, be ready to blow your bankroll and have a great night here.,2017-11-30,oxQY2r3yNkEEhvVq6sU0Mg,
