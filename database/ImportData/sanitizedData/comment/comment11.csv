2lF1UsGcDpDpaI1lXgRX_g,I've ate here more times than I can count over the years. But after today I will never eat here again. I asked for extra salsa and added the hot to it was mixing it up and found a piece of chip in it. Asked the server if they keep chips by salsa she said no. So either employees are eating chips and salsas out of what they serve customers or they pure the old stuff off tables back in. Either way that's sick and wrong.

The salad came and as I started to cut the peelings off my cucumber slices a tiny spider ran up my thumb..holy crap!  Then when the muffins came they were not done, dough was raw inside and the mushrooms I asked for smelled old..everytime I have ever been to the Alma School location the food and service has been superb not the case at the Gilbert location. I won't go back there. The server was good not her fault.,2013-07-06,sGyUt0QAVhPyH44u-V0fyw,

The only options are to valet (complimentary, but we all know how that works) or really far down and across the street. Lo- Lo's needs to work out the parking issues. It really does make me consider going other places for lunch.,2015-02-13,huFaudv5ojjJ29khAe8Bvw,

BgQ5ob0QiZfO5YbgI7VyFw,I was happy with the dish I had!  The chile relleno was delicious as well as the pork tamale! The salsa was okay but not great.  I was confused at the menu of why they would serve so many fish dishes?  If its considered a new Mexican cuisine. The server was horrendous not very knowledgeable about the menu. Never came back to refill water or order another beer.  The food was good enough to give it another shot I hope the service will be better.,2013-05-25,DwUybsWia_Imktay1uoaMg,

plEghR2-XhS5WtZAmp-x5Q,Took my family on a Tuesday since the unlimited wristband is only $15 then. ""Unlimited"" only applies to mini golf, go karts and bumper boats so you really have to be repeatative on each to get your moneys worth. I was kind of disappointed when I found out that you have to bring your own stuff for the batting cages because that what I was looking forward to the most!

0X_J5lCwM12tJ8Esv-0lgg,Came in 2 weeks ago. I waited behind the person being helped and the lady working there acknowledged me a couple min later (Keep in mind I'm the only person in line). She stopped helping her co-worker, got on her computer and began eating. I waited a good 5 min before she remembered I was standing 5ft from her and she looked over and asked me if I needed help.

9g1GP5prqzQKw4zMpvkuQw,I highly recommend this location if you need a car! The staff here are amazing and very professional. They helped me out quickly and met my needs perfectly! The only con to my experience was that they didnt clean out the car before giving it to me so the guy helping us rent had to go in and spray a few parts down but the seats were a tad bit dirty! I will be coming back though! :),2013-04-02,FRMtV7S4ETzZctD7X2akaQ,

BpqggO7klU9Ky6WnVin1rg,Do not go here!! Longest lines I have ever seen. Worse then Disney land!! We were here for 5 hours and only got to go on 2 rides and the lazy river. Biggest waste of $$ ever. They absolutely move as slowly as possible, obviously trying to convince people to spend an extra $20-$30 on a fast pass. Go to sunsplash instead- their lines actually MOVE and they don't do shady bs moves to force you into spending more money. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!,2014-08-10,pQ8qmUnAZH0hYToenRS57Q,

fercXJpucosaQr-1NdlSSg,Serious cleanliness and maintenance issues here. Locker rooms are dirty, they're so lazy, rather than fixing soap dispensers, they put out a dirty industrial bottle of soap with a broken pump spout. Sauna benches have loose boards.

Bigger problem is the location, in the Frank Lloyd Wright - Raintree mess of streets and construction.,2013-02-05,zHQktqtMfzqT318aTzwVBQ,

The subs are okay well in the 1980's this is how food tasted and it's a trip back in time before we had other things to snack on. This is my favorite place. Also on a note. The sandwich is bland and the bread is mediocre. Overall it tastes like it's from the '80's. Maybe think of using Boars Head meats instead of cheap quality.,2014-06-03,ocAUlzNwEUkkPPoxJ9-wVA,

kUTusjnUPVZUgUJc2GuWuA,Called on Friday night to see if I came in around 10 pm would a table be open for myself and my fiancé   He said they close at 10. I told him the website says 11 pm  he then said oh no that's only sat. So I called the chandler location to see if they were open late. They told me the scottsdale one is open till 11 on Fridays.  So just fair warning of this place. Seems like they might be lazy or dishonest at this spot.,2015-04-04,ksDQJa_zrWbUmC7GzqG5rA,

8E2Uc0Mn4cn_yEY0xFv-9A,First impressions are everything. I totally feel like I got the bait and switch. I called to make an oil change appointment and was quoted 30-40 minute wait time. Upon arriving at the dealership less than 5 minutes later my wait time was now 1.5 - 2 hours. Not cool. It'll be a long wait before I give them another opportunity. The upside is the service advisor was super friendly. Sucks the dealership has to pull this type of stunt. I had great expectations for Right Toyota. #dirty,2014-05-24,JZIkTcPpHQ_zeTt-32E-VA,

CsdDwluwDz6NpiSx3QfToA,For just over eight bucks I got a half pepperoni half Hawaiian on the original style crust . I went home skeptical that I could make a good pizza in a conventional oven. I cooked for 10 min on the prepanned then cooked for a remaining 8 minutes by switching to a pizza stone. I popped it on the counter and cut it into right hearty pieces. Let it cool for 3 mins. First bite I was blown away it was excellent, super  cheesy and the crust was crunch and dowey.  I am a fan I highly recommend.,2013-08-01,BArjH2vHo5adQcjAWi_2_A,
