3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw,Six pieces of chicken fingers with fries and refillable soda for Yu-go and I to share. Spicy Cane and honey mustard dip was important to have to make the not too greasy fingers pallible. Crinkle fries were bland and unseasoned. Diet Pepsi was flat and diluted.

A3BzaW-pEmIH4Fu6dav7HA,My first choice for chicken fried steak was at the old and gone Baja Beach at the Fiesta.

A3BzaW-pEmIH4Fu6dav7HA,Yu-go had a few bites of his doctored up standard grade prime rib. It had been pre-cut by an amature snd left to dry. Way way too salty and unpleasantly tough chewing. Another 24 hours of Adoph and the meat would become corned beef. His salty split pea soup was barely warm enough to enjoy . My tasteless SW Burger did not come with sliced avocado but rather bland guacamole as a spread. Sad to say, this is the worst meal we've ever had had at this beautiful restaurant facility.,2016-12-16,mkbx55W8B8aPLgDqex7qgg,

The beef was super doctored up to a point where Yu-go said another hour of tenderizing would turn it into corned beef. Roasted pork & fried chicken were very tasty.,2016-11-13,mkbx55W8B8aPLgDqex7qgg,

The waiting line monitors and especially their supervisors are not the slickest. They are on their feet all day in the heat and cold. The drivers lift thousands of pounds each day. Show your appreciation by tipping them. If you have a beef with the rental car agency, talk to the station manager. They usually make things right for you.

aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,Community entrance and exit greeting. Try not to look startled. A bow is a friendly acknowledgement even if you don't understand a word of Korean. Seating capacity is for 175 persons. Parking could be problematic. The restaurant size, ambience and noise level can initially be over powering.,2016-09-11,mkbx55W8B8aPLgDqex7qgg,
aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,Skirt Meat Combo for four on a Monday evening. Table service second to none. Three of us could not finish the entire meal.

I bought 2 different brands at about $75 Delta and $65 waterpic ... it felt like I was settling... more options with better reference to what you are looking at would be nice. Then again, I am certain that I would not find one that preforms like a pressure washer. I may be the only person in the world who's required for a shower head to be able to strip paint from a car.

-FtngCwHCD2tRlH8jpj_Ag,They seem to have switched to chicken breast meat on the sage fried chicken... it doesn't have the ability to  take on the sage flavor so it is not bold tasting. The meat also comes out much more dry and a little tough. The re-made my order but it came out the same. They offered  to let me try again or switch. The service was great... just a little sad that my favorite dish and reason for coming here is not the same.

BmIJ_sPpIpIKsP3vubus8g,City of Henderson Parks and Recreation Department-You need to add one of the most important rules-DO NOT FEED THE WILDLIFE! It is already a DISASTER up in Aliante and Sunset  Park. All waterfowl don't need human food to survive. Those  who come to feed them are only messing up  their daily routine and in the long run affecting  their health and their ability to find their own food source. They will also lose their fear of humans and become aggressive. Please take a page from Hemenway Park! \uuu\/,2015-05-10,3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,

kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,2nd time dining in new location. I'm sad to say the service has gone WAY downhill. Not only have we asked for things multiple times and not received them, the attitude staff has given is irritating. We asked for toasted bread a couple times. The second time we asked, the server said, ""it wasn't warm enough for you?"" and then brought out burnt bread. We asked for hot sauce three times and still no sign of it. Maybe we'll get it for dessert. It's not that busy in here and I can see why.,2013-06-17,BJ3nuPOcaqPuYlIulu7yXQ,

wWDQDPuuwQ5kFeT2a72b6Q,The ricotta meatballs are delicious but extremely spicy.  Do NOT order the Mac and cheese with truffle sauce it's chalky and truffle sauce has no truffle flavor. The flatbread fondue (pictured) is tasteless and bland, not to mention a small strip of prosciutto was the only thing that gave the dish flavor. Also it was super chalky and not creamy as a fondue should be. I would skip on the appetizer selection altogether.  Unless you are ordering the meatballs.,2014-03-14,JM8Uao_GOpr7alfBZm5OBQ,

OFnDWBP8iXxgeBrfHA5fRA,Do not stay here! We replaced our 10 year tradition of staying and playing here with the Golden Nugget. Many memories here, very sad!! Playing here is an entirely different experience though. Normally pretty loose machines (been kinda tight for a couple months now),2014-10-12,nhSxB72PI_uxg9vwKxPpkg,
BIBWGO_r_1znnlmLbp4Nxg,Cleaner then the 4Queens rooms.  Use to be pretty loose but noticed the last three months have been pretty tight. If you want to play here I would suggest the machines by the bathrooms by Grottos, I've always done pretty well in that area. Both slots and video poker. Also the large bar by the cashier.,2015-08-30,nhSxB72PI_uxg9vwKxPpkg,

4v4-h0rAl5XZY1NCpHU30g,Tailgating here is awesome.  Even the dirt field on the south side is worth the $15 cash. The environment is friendly and the sharks and scalpers are minimal. The only major issue is the that they have no Porta john's on this side of the stadium so you have to walk all the way around to use the restroom.,2013-12-21,FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,
4v4-h0rAl5XZY1NCpHU30g,The seating here is pretty good. Almost every seat is a good one.  Seriously there are very few bad seats in the house. Day time games get a little cold on the south and west side because of the lack of sun but it's not too bad.,2013-12-21,FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,

BmIJ_sPpIpIKsP3vubus8g,With so many new parks opening up it's hard to choose a favorite. This one is high on my list. Whitney Mesa was near the top till it burned up. Things to like great bathrooms,  many shade areas, benches for oldies to rest on the walk\/run path, water with wild life. The list goes on and on.  I have one negative. It's not close to home like the wetlands. But I have to give it to Hendo for some of the best parks now. Will the County regain the title?,2013-06-01,deY-YVlabd-SgHJpYKdzVA,
