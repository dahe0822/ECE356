It was also very tough and flavorless. I thought I couldn't go wrong with mashed potatoes and gravy, but I was wrong. The gravy was runny and lacked flavor.

I got a 15 minute massage for $5 and it was better than going to get a massage for $80!! The guys take their time... But it's worth the wait. The only thing is that they always forget the trunk lol... But a very small price to pay for all the awesomeness I get. Also, going through the car wash is fun...

shSYKGuSzXpctURCR9kCFQ,Awesome customer service, super friendly people at the front! The food is on point and tasty. Their ulam doesn't come with rice but that's okay. Rice is an extra $1.25. Their food is a couple dollars cheaper than the filipino food place down the street (DT's) which works for me because the taste is still there and they give very good portions! Look out DT's Filipino Food! I just found my new favorite Filipino food spot :),2015-03-21,ATwKhh6I02oRdIFvTEkcog

EFPrQuqF0qMit_iCpVa-6A,I'm a regular here but ever since they remodeled they changed the way they do things. For example, they used to give the shots to your animal or dog anyway right in the room with you present. Now they weigh and do everything In the back room where eyes can't see. I liked the old way better. So I can see the actual weight on the scale and see my dog getting the 3 shots that I paid for. Not that I don't trust but it gives me piece of mind. Can they start doing this again? Does anyone else agree?,2015-04-22,8cV9qy8BFUDu6VXrni9v6w

They are all Hispanic and don't seem to understand your order or name very well. Reminds me of the nail salons.  The food is good but not for the prices. The ambiance is nice but very small. We eat there because the food is pretty good and right around the corner. I would mostly like the staff to greet you more friendly and the prices to come down a bit.,2013-04-21,klvGDhcEBmqfwlwyawk94A

WI1xBMN_rEaVPOL9Ad2gpQ,I'm very surprised that this restaurant has not reached out to me. The first year we went there I gave them 4 stars. The next year after eating the wonderful Wagyu steak and the great service I moved them up to 5 stars. But after ordering the Wagyu steak again this year and both my husband and I both getting  sick... steak was too salty. also we've heard NOTHING from them. That's very disappointing after spending $500 for a meal. It was reported right away too. Not cool.,2017-06-26,dXCcQD7RyStWmmG-8hkiPA

Also, buy your own inner tubes at the local CVS, Walgreens or Target for $4-$6 & fill them up with air for free at the tube shop near the lazy river.

MJVOAxBhAGT_0jvOwPotNQ,Wow is it hot! We have only been here a few minutes but here are a few of our suggestions: 1) bring\/wear sunscreen and hat ; 2) bring a chair and\/or scout out a spot in the shaded dining tent; those spaces are going to go fast; 3) they do not have any festival maps to show you where each truck is located, so you have to just walk around and check it all out; 4) Hydrate!! Hydration is happiness!! Bring a water bottle - they are not checking bags at the gate. Have fun and see you all around!!,2016-09-10,8pmxwY_nmXYBzKPa-klk3Q

It costs $10 to park, and if you arrive after 8, there is a cover charge.  So, for a party of four, it could easily cost you $30 just to get in the door.  It is at a very nice location, the architecture is very nice, and the scenery is great, but the clientele are now middle-age frat-boy boat owners.  You know the type.  I've given up on the place.,2015-08-01,vhIvwYuEeRvU354jYILIYA

z4K95Y4P5nMrtJiDtXWDYA,There was no music playing, and when I go to a Mexican restaurant, I expect to hear a mariachi band, or some sort of music, but it was dead silence, so we were forced to listen to the people's  conversation next to us. A stiff drink and a little music, and you can get past the bad food and bad service. It was just a really weird evening of a sitting in a restaurant and hearing everyone's conversations and no ambiance.

Everything was an extra charge even coffee in the room every single day and I don't mean room service. Room service is minimal and they shut down all the restaurants and  room service early and you're left with eating at a deli for dinner if you don't eat early.

Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJ-ZimtnA,Don't be surprised to see these cute animals in your room. Room service sucks in this hotel. Room doesn't have a single drawer. I purchased my vacation directly from Venetian and I am not coming here back again. I decided to reserve this hotel after I heard about the Renovation recently. I usually stay at Bellagio where I always stay happy. The casino in Venetian is 5 times smaller than Bellagio's casino. Casino is not as clean . Room service sucks. Sorry but Venetian is not better than 3.5 hote,2013-12-23,JqEHyGNJRROQyhKPKHsrFg

The lobster bisque and pecan pie are  superb, which is pretty much the highlight of this meal. Don't be fooled by the positive review on the steak and don't raise ur expectation.

El4FC8jcawUVgw_0EIcbaQ,Make SURE they don't put you in the South Tower unless you want a trash can for a view. You also feel like you are underground. Not my idea of Vegas! This is a maintenance tower w a strange & shady entrance. You can even take the elevator to the basement where service stuff was. It was my first impression of MGM and it wasn't good. However, their customer service gets an A+. They were very accommodating and moved us to the Grand Tower where the entrance is beautiful and we have a decent view now,2013-08-22,UTw_BpfRFlP4TBcqGh97Mw

Pob7ibbNT29--69nxXEP2g,Beautiful place with lovely bartenders! I'd get the Fire Breathing Dragon only for the crazy cocktail experience. Its definitely not for anything else at $14. The purée is just too thick and overbearing to the alcohol ratio. It felt like sipping a very sweet, thick syrup so it'll be better with an extra shot & some club soda. ;) A security guard came over to check IDs of my friends & I sitting at Chandelier's 2nd floor bar.

u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ,Great location and GO ROOMS were amazing! Pool area was gorgeous but go early! People line up for the free chairs or do what we did and reserve a daybed, seats 6 people and get drinks in price too! Ask for upgrade specials! For only $30 more we got a upgrade and it overlooked the strip! Could see the bellagio water fountains all night! But beware of the elevators! They take forever!!! We got stuck in one almost made it late to the wedding! Eek! And don't waste money on the X Burlesque!,2013-08-20,Uum5X9-OzW-blCwp_Ueuxw

WTt8_zwy4IXaB2QnuiQP1Q,Great drinks! But when we tried to make reservations, told they don't do that. So when we showed up, we had to wait with some ropes, and we were waiting on couple more people. Told they couldn't seat us till full party was there. Then they ended up seating everyone at two different tables, huge space between (which was servers expo) so not a great experience with a larger group. But if smaller like 4 or under the food was pricey but good.,2013-08-20,Uum5X9-OzW-blCwp_Ueuxw

Saavy negotiation with the lounge registration folks on the casino floor helps too.  Groups of ladies are wise to make friends with the various lounge hostesses, who compete for your patronage.  Look for the politely polished & uber-cool gent named Christian, who circulates between the casino floor and the clubs in his customized Gucci wheelchair.  It's even got rims on it!

The lady at the desk was immensely rude, she told me that if I wanted to mail a box I would have to purchase a 5 dollar roll of tape, regardless if there were dozens of people using tape on the counters already. She took my own mail out of my hands, without permission, and proceeded to ""self weigh"" it, telling me how much it would cost. I walked out livid, I'd never go back. They take people out of line, let other people cut in line, I waited 20 minutes.,2014-05-02,59bTLakzXimME61GuLoBpA

3fdtp-bzoE4ZgTakkcEBzQ,Vegas has so much to offer! Whether it be making it rain by shopping, stuffing your face with never ending delicious food, taking risks on gambling, partying it up at the day\/night clubs, watching concerts or plays--or simply enjoying Vegas itself. #Sincity #Baegas,2015-12-11,X0Kf2g4NMYsRjWQ0QeNm0A
I6ICIIZfZsp_J9hHmfhWhQ,Driving down the strip during night time is the worse! It'll take you half an hour just to get to the other end, if not longer! Day time is alright but watch out for taxis as they think they own the road! I suggest to walk to get around and wear comfy footwear. Of course, you'll still find girls trying to walk the walk in heels. Pshh, good luck! They have LV strip maps available in all casinos\/resorts for free. I'd take one just in case.,2015-12-13,X0Kf2g4NMYsRjWQ0QeNm0A

f8IMQgRwo-8GP372MElDGQ,Room service is apparently outsourced, you must use the room phone, to make contact, but that is useless because no one answers. Wake up calls are non existent here as well because no one is at the front desk. Must be a cost cutting strategy to have no employees available to perform these jobs.  Fire alarm blared in the room and hallway at 6am due to maintenance working on it. Seems like a better time to work on the fire alarm would be late morning.
