GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,We came here for lunch and loved it. Yelp had three stars but our experience was five. We had the guacamole (awesome!) carnitas and mole tacos. They also have a duck toungue taco called silencio. I laughed. I had a flight of tequila and enjoyed the sangrita, but the signature margarita with it's salt air was far better. Had a little kick, but it was awesome. At lunch on a Tuestday the service was quick and our server, Rich, was awesome.,2013-06-11,jW37YOkSmBUc4NSf9WF4Ng,
cdPnRYnfKrbeEUAoSJONtw,Went at 6:30 on a Wednesday night with 30 minutes left for happy hour. The carnita street tacos were our favorite and the guacamole was also very good. The house margarita was also very good. Service was quick and friendly with a reminder just before 7 that happy hour was closing and, ""would we like anything else?""  Happy hour is a win here.,2013-07-10,jW37YOkSmBUc4NSf9WF4Ng,
YJ8ljUhLsz6CtT_2ORNFmg,Loved it. The pub chips with onion dip was fantastic as was the cheese dip with pretzel bread.

Our server, Ali, was pleasant and knowledgable. He checked often and the service was fantastic all around,2013-06-09,jW37YOkSmBUc4NSf9WF4Ng,

DbDnkoaPM_znq_2j2CXrQQ,Ok. So this is not the staff's responsibility. Still. We live very close by and get all the coupons.  Meh. I have always trashed them. Last time ""$210"" worth of coupon. After years of receiving them, I actually try to use one.  Yet. The BK ten minutes away doesn't accept coupons. And there is Nothing on the coupons that indicates where they are accepted or not accepted. Actually,  no addresses of any BK. Seriously. A buck or two savings from a coupon doesn't break me. It's the damned principle.,2017-05-01,GHGmop3jse_iIr0PK2-mpw,

wltfqot_Et0r-DYaZDxWFA,The fish tacos were good, would have loved a lime and the pork popcorn bites were unique and a nice change from the average popcorn chicken. I was expecting less ""bar"" food, a little more restaurant grade, So if I go back I'll stay away from fried food and try the bbq pork. Hopefully they will recreate their nacho recipe, the cheese is clumped together, but the salsa is good therefore chips and salsa would have been better.,2015-11-13,IpXGWrBxF9sriBx5LuuhaQ,

Yelp has a very bad habit of not ""recommending"" good reviews by actual customers, and ""recommending"" negative reviews from fake yelpers who have never been to the location. Yelp is not a reliable source of information on any business.,2015-11-17,dHQ1CxU66FgBStR7XV-gRg,

I was absolutely mortified. But they were so awesome and just told me to bring the rest sometime that day. Even though they've never met me before they were so trusting and sweet. Luckily my husband was in the area so he could come by and pay the remaining. But I was so thankful! And Becky the pa that did my exam was awesome!,2014-04-21,7NpCsI26qybtzLrkxBpRtQ,

LJ6F0Vyias0EpuXAqGcA0Q,I have some serious hair OCD and when I need a cut, I NEED a CUT! Called Hair Pollution (after having a great first experience) and I got in to see Jalen. She was awesome, honest about what my hair was capable of, and she listened to what I wanted. I really liked the cut when she was finished (I have a really cute, short cut with shaved sides that taper up) but I'm LOVING it as it grows out! I'll definitely go back for a 3rd and 4th and 5th time ;) fair prices, great atmosphere, awesome people.,2014-01-04,IGbt_1mP0NYRiRvCBVsVcw,

yGMCl0vYigshkXiZFIDTNw,This place was horrible! We were sat in a booth at 8 pm yesterday night and our waiter was not enthusiastic. Our water came with our meals. She forgot one of our salads. She ONLY brought one bread basket with 2 breads when we had 3 people and she failed to bring more. She came and asked us how our food was as two of us were chewing and one was choking. When no one replied she asked good? And walked away, as our friend was choking. This experience was terrible,2014-02-08,luAf57wzjyWX1lQR6sVinA,
yGMCl0vYigshkXiZFIDTNw,This experience was terrible enough but since we wanted to celebrate we wanted some desert. After finally getting to the end of our meal, we were expecting a warm invite to dessert but instead the waiter slammed a receipt on our table and said good night. We didn't even have a chance to say we wanted dessert so we had to go to IHOP. We were furious and when we wanted to talk to a manager or a host, no one was around the place was deserted.,2014-02-08,luAf57wzjyWX1lQR6sVinA,

hSbCSR7F8HAwfoZcm0jpww,I have never had a long wait or slow service.  Staff has always been great and professional.  As i have been to many restaurants, i can compare easily.  If the place is busy, be patient.  If you go out to eat, give them time and relax.  I would rather have time to relax than have someone on me right away.  Unfortunately too many people get in a hurry.  To this, i just say, if anyone is in that much of a hurry, get fast food.  For me, i want Red Lobster.,2016-03-21,g8IQDvFG4cNek0MaIG7mcA,
dQZOCI_IIxrUKPnRa56yog,I love this place.  I do wish they had stuffed cabbage though.  Maybe they will start making it.  My mom wants it also.  Please start making stuffed cabbage.

P6l-uuN3v4Z6WEAkSLV_ug,I run in for donuts and Starbucks coffee as well as breakfast burritos and their pizza. While the pizza is pricey, it's quite good. The produce is often not turned over fast enough and expensive, so unless it's a great sale, I'd skip. This is more of a large convenience store than a place I'd do my regular shopping. Exception: meat department. For fresh cuts 2"" steaks, or large meat orders (i.e.:standing rib roasts) it is my favorite. The butchers are great!,2015-11-05,cs6biPoaG9SmtVB44hU9Sw,

Rude to a customer walking the lot (infront of me and my wife while he was ""helping"" us) and then became noticeably angry and hostile when I said the numbers he was spewing out on payments weren't making sense. He did mention his uncle owned the Subaru and jeep dealerships so maybe he feels he can act however he wants. If you live in the west valley and want a new Subaru the dealership seems nice but do not deal with spencer.,2016-09-01,lcwL_U6NsKg_4TVbA3MAHQ,

9QAZTNPS6P8PYTnO_z9TRA,Worse salon to ever touch my hair. I have platinum blonde hair that was orange and grayish purple after 2.5hrs of being there. The stylist was fairly new in experience. Not one stylist offered to help while watching her color my hair twice with toner over and over. I have relocated here and what a sorry disappointment. This was a horrible experience. I went in willing to spend whatever it took to get my hair done correctly. I was never asked what ""level"" of a stylist that I wanted either.,2013-07-30,2YSJC16Y6CDBfAHDF12pTg,

mmMihsgFSb_7fp5rAXiW_A,My experience with Ryan Ray was not good. He promised me that my deposit was refundable and demanded I put down $1000 for an allocated car. I had every intention by buying the car, but it was gonna take a while to get since it was a new 2018. I decided not to get the car after 2 weeks, and I was told the deposit is not refundable. Ryan Ray lied to me. I wouldn't trust anything that comes out of this guy's mouth. Be very careful!,2017-07-31,o3JDA9aJLoJDrhCXudc4ew,

Before the car arrived, I changed my mind. They refused to give me my $1000 deposit back. I had to raise hell to finally get it back. What a scam. Buyer beware!,2017-08-07,o3JDA9aJLoJDrhCXudc4ew,

GKCX2DlxkbwY2DUu44u4rA,Had no clue this location was here. I found it tucked away behind a gas station\/Mc Donald's after a pregnancy craving demanded I have cheese enchiladas.

4UmjnX46qbhV6-D5W89IOQ,I am a vegetarian. If you say vegetarian style, normally they make whatever you want with beans instead of ground beef. Well, this time I ordered vegetarian style the guy just put extra tomatoes. When I bit into my crunch wrap (which you can't see unless you've taken a bite) there was nothing but ground beef and tomatoes on it. I brought it back & the guy told me it was MY fault because he didn't know what vegetarian meant. They offered to make me more food but no refund.

This week when I called they told me they could not deliver to me because my order isn't over $20. I live less than a block away and can't leave at night because my infant son goes to bed early which leaves me home-bound. I've always happily paid the $3 delivery fee and tipped generously...
