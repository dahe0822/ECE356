We were greeted by a good waitress and also by someone who could have been the owner. Once the food arrived i can say that i was highly disappointed. All of the sides were cold as if they keep the food out all day and just wait to cook your choice of meat. After two bites of my food i decided that i could take no more.I would not recommend this place.,2014-04-02,XCldm5U2MGjqV6kvVt5Xxg

dRib7YK9Mtqgvfqsf-PKrw,I've had Uncle Maddio's delivered twice via GrubHub. The first time was a revelation. The pizza was so good, so intensely flavorful and perfectly prepared that we were like, whaaaat? No way. So we ordered a second time a few weeks later, with low expectations. We figured we'd be chasing that Uncle Maddio's high forever without catching it, you know? Wrong. Again, a fantastic pizza. The toppings are truly first-rate. The salads are great. And this review is based on delivery, remember.,2016-09-25,n5WrquwVv3fo_IgDfyt5IA

O_Arou6ZJP0A2pS65PPFcg,The LONGEST wait ever for a grilled cheese and soup. It was almost an hour and there was another guy in there who waited longer than me. It's literally one of the most bizarre scenes ever - a medical marijuana lounge, a mysterious upstairs where random people just kept appearing from, a shitty DJ playing crap house versions of Metallica and Nirvana - BUT they have amazing grilled cheese and soup. Not worth an hour wait but pretty damn good!,2014-05-03,ZQLfrOKl5BSIacqZ1uUduw

M3Tnb8WfVP8aEfiFyUuuYg,Just purchased a 2004 BMW 745LI on Sat Jan 31. I received the most amazing customer service from a sale rep by the name of Anthony Mario. He got me in the car I wanted at a very reasonable price. I had an issue with the car when I got it and they fixed asap. I took the car in at 9am and had it back by 3pm the same day!!!. They also put me in a real nice loaner car. So if  you are looking for a car and want stress free service. Go see Mario Anthony :-),2015-02-04,MbSG3TwWOKgFLFEfpVuCfQ

They had some dishes new to us! Fav dish was the Chicken Tikka Masala. Flavors were nice & even. Some Indian buffets do not have much for a ""salad"" section, but here they did.

uXZ4Of7CV77SmKIjya3y_A,Here's a tip: if you like your appetizers hot,  don't eat here.  The nachos have grated cheese, but they don't bother heating them up,  so it just stays in an awkward pile and falls off as you attempt to finagle a chip into your mouth.  Ditto with the artichoke dip. It's effing cold. But they're so nice they'll warm it up for you.  Haha,2016-10-15,WeHffRGwXVuqdQyOxsAg0Q

mm5QdFwO4Y7LsAxI0-S9Mw,  commented this to former foster mom of the dog. Said she would hold the dog a week or 2 until my husb. gets better. I inquired about my dog during that week. After 1 week, I wanted my doggie back, they said no. Foster mom gave me Diana's #, I texted her 2 times. She was extremely Rude. I took dog to vet. I was treated like a criminal. Check out pics.,2015-12-05,YA3Uxb99iOdGbEG254-L6Q

If your food is going to taste horrible and mostly be cold you should lower your prices after 8pm or just close early.

k1lSQ4VIqEn36UL1zkb3dw,VIPS is among my favorite non-AYCE sushi restaurants, simply because their maki deliciousness is absolutely off the charts! Despite the small space we've never had an issue , the place is mostly take out so people don't stay in long (but you can). Ingredient substitutions are not a problem, I've been there with a non-seafood eater friend who loved the food. If you love to experiment with food, they have some unusual maki choices too. Food is fresh and made right in front of you. I recommend!,2017-02-04,FyEBB-qyuceqzyK-wa3DPw

YpeS8EsUROSllHHWbjNkFA,For those of you returning vehicles: go into the self-park garage at the Bellagio. Head up the outside ramp to the third level (you'll see an Avis sign). Turn right to enter the garage at that point. Park the car and take the keys down to the main lobby area (Casino level). Go to where the valet people are, and you'll notice a grouping of stone sculptures. Behind there is a small Avis office. Drop keys off there.,2015-04-26,MPkeTFBtU7dzfPc1r8fpeQ

xEBor41OFpeeKdcCZ2sfMg,The staff is not prepared. We were seated at a table with no silverware. Took at least 10 minutes for chips, salsa and drinks. At least 5 more minutes for the arrogant waiter to rush us thru our order and act like we seated ourselves at an unprepared table. Still no silverware. Oh.... Chips were crumbs. Salsa was good. Finally after asking for napkins and being ignored we left. Still didn't have silverware,2014-03-03,s-x91tjLGlGGuhyN4RoSkg

xEBor41OFpeeKdcCZ2sfMg,The only restaurant we've ever walked out of starving. The chips and salsa were delicious, the food was so bland that we asked for green chile or anything we could put on it to make it taste like anything. We were told they had no green chile, or sauce because everything was already made. What? We noticed that people around us were drowning their food in salsa. The manager did comp the entire  meal...would recommend to go elsewhere,2014-03-22,Rk0xpV1Q9dNEpJHJgY1seg

kywgPe0g6aVoq4VOMRMX1w,We ordered take out because there was no seating available when we arrived. We ordered the Ruben, the eggs benedict and the pancakes. The pancakes are a hearty filling choice, a fluffy texture yet cinnamon taste. The reuben has a sort of co-mingling taste, everything in this sandwich works well together. The eggs Benedict will not be ordered again, I found the tofu too thick under the yolk of the egg, the tomato on the eggs benedict also provided a rather strange taste, there was no ham either.,2017-02-19,PyuwkgMhG87l8yimRfT41w

PAZC7ENEmDDgNMZngJSxxg,Good selection of domestic beers, along with some Europeans, staff is friendly and informed in regards to offering help to selecting beers. Bring a cushion if you are sitting at the bar, stools are uncomfortable. Will give them another try for food as I found the wings bland, pizza crust seemed store bought and bone marrow undercooked. Friends stated burger was delicious though. Still early days to judge, expectations are high and really hope they can deliver,2014-02-17,dEJtYNnRAFwyTukJfAOXMg
PAZC7ENEmDDgNMZngJSxxg,The service is consintently poor, especially after 8 or 9 pm. I have a love for local beer and good local food but after almost a dozen occasions of coming here,  it never changes. Everytime I come here I want to love what they're doing but the execution is terrible. Waitress can just be flat out rude. Waitress messed up our beer order and insisted she was right. She also forgot our food order (another waitress came and told our party). Plenty of better quaility establishments on the same street,2015-01-11,C9TbQ7TGeeFRRjiq9TOf_Q

I couldn't resist their cheesecake and boy did it taste just like back home in NJ! We will be regulars for sure! About time Henderson had some quality restaurants!,2014-03-22,7jLEbMTtJznxw0b4Oy6WxQ

NyDsVcZ0bfYZH-ZQrpFAmQ,I hit a curb while driving and messed up 2 of my rims and tires. It was sent to service kings and sat there for about a week until 4 new tires and wheels got there. These were very expensive sets. You would think they would keep them secure at all times and not just laying out in their back yard. They were stolen. Apparently a ""tow truck"" came and someone saw them load up the tires and wheels. They called us about what happened THE NEXT DAY at noon. It happened the afternoon before. Unbelievable,2016-08-05,B1iUMmvnPT_5T61Trd4axg

He loves using local farm milk and coffee from a local roaster. You don't find many businesses that focus on supporting local food suppliers. The service and food were both excellent. Sometimes people can have bad days. If your visit here wasn't to your liking I'm sure that the owner would appreciate your feedback.,2017-08-14,ayatzs_EgllPALJzSn5IPw

-rZhTL7Dd04wgWdkk61CZQ,DON'T MOVE HERE! The property is up for sale. The current owners are not going to invest any more money for necessary or broken problems with this property. The maintenance staff is too small to handle this complex. All you get our lies from the front office. Sometimes management doesn't want or even care what is going on in their own complex.

w-bCLcuiZSHYq4QAtuiJiw,I've been coming here for months and I've never left disappointed. They're not just staff, they're friends. They know all their customers by name and make a very fun comfortable environment. They all know what they're doing and are very patient. I'm picky about my nails and I'm not afraid to say if one of them is uneven or whatever. If I point something out they will fix it no complaints. But that rarely happens anyway.

pGwfOqNEL8FbMUFspJdAMA,I love this place. Finally good mexican food. The guacamole patron was outstanding.  They made it exactly how I like it. My husband had a  traditional non alcoholic drink ""Horchata"" witch was to die for. I had a home made sangria and loved it. Not too sweet, that was just perfect.  Food was good I  dont like too spicy so they made it just right . Its about time they have vallet parking because the first time I was there it was had to find parking. I would definitely be back .,2014-05-31,heq86SiZDT3H6-Ky1Bo9Hw

Too funny also that ""Erin"" who gave the 5 star review is a waitress there and she is probably the one who is the loudest.  If you enjoy burnt bacon, cold toast, and overdone eggs then this is the place to be.  Otherwise, go anywhere else in madison.

Mz8SxYTJaXKOjW60zWo-TA,A few tips for a safe home! Bee season starts as early as late February thru October. During these times inspect your home on a regular basis for bee activity. Typical places to inspect would be eves of your home ,under or around sheds, valve boxes, along the bottom of home, and water spigots. Make sure to call with first signs of bee activity because with bee removal it's always best to solve the problem sooner than later and have a much larger problem.,2017-03-25,jML_BW5epui-vHWHxbO9nQ

yyYpTY4dhfnX_-4UJEWUcg,Management Tip:Lyndsey Gersia dear, I did have a magnificent day as your staff chirpped to me after that debacle of a day at your store. Your are very immature, unprofessional, and unpleasant to look at with your grumpy gills. Get happy if you are going to be in customer service. Stop being so difficult to work with and for crying out loud Stephen, man up and hold her accountable for making such a negative impression on your store. To future shoppers, count how many items you have before leaving,2016-08-08,Inh6RQ9BjpV05V74OLYV4g

Not only is the owner amazing and sweet, but the other hair stylists were amazing too. The salon has an amazing design (you'll have to see for yourself...I can't even describe it's so awesome) I recommend anyone looking for excellent hair services to come here.

We are not sure we would want to go back after our last visit. The hotdog quality was not there. It was shriveled up and mushy. The toppings did not taste fresh. The fries didn't taste fully cooked and the toppings for the fries were lacking flavor. The condiments tasted watered down. The overall environment felt sticky and dirty.

Before the bill came, I asked him if they ran out of the bourbon that was supposed to be used & was told that it was indeed in stock. However, the bill was not adjusted accordingly. Makes me wonder how many times the same stunt has been pulled on others. To my mind, it's tantamount to stealing from your customers.

o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw,The food was really good. The mango lassi was particularly good.  It was all highly spiced (but not too spicy) which I enjoyed.  The butter chicken didn't have cream which I thought was odd but it was still very good. The only thing I didn't love was the samosa, and their mint chutney wasn't my favorite.

UxWH8zRYIBgs6Q2oykvRdw,I had my brunch reservation to celebrate my anniversary booked a month in advance. I was so excited to go to Cluny. Place is stunning and people were very nice. I wanted it to keep being awesome. Unfortunately I ordered the Maple Bourbon pancakes. I received 3 pancakes: 1 was burnt, 1 was raw, and thank god 1 was good. I've never been out for pancakes and seen them cooked so badly. In the end, I didn't bother to say anything (not my style) and left. Pretty disappointing anniversary brunch.,2015-05-03,jTvKXxLigFiw4yyhvp9kjw

I have enjoyed each and every dish I've had. And you always get treated in a very personal, warm way; like family. Yes, the place is small.

xJ94FRxbFwkmpi1hjuWlaw,Prices are on par with other locally owned pizza spots.  Let me start off by saying the pizza was good!  We got half the Rocky Reitano half Supremo after the owner suggested we did half and half specialty pizza.  Which was really cool.  Now for the digs.  The staff was way unorganized!  The owner seemed very frazzled and I wouldn't even say they were busy in the least.  Overall good product, service needs major tweaking.  We'll give it another shot! Hopefully they get it together!,2014-09-04,7BdhgpYYT_XKBce9qzahZA

5CYCDOboVAI9t1FjfsDcLg,I want to say that Yelp is an incredibly unscrupulous business to deal with. After refusing to advertise with them, they took our only true REAL reviews and created them as ""Not Recommended"" and left the one ""placed"" that could be proven as a False review and left that one in place. Bottom line DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH YELP!  We would love nothing more than to remove our listing, but YELP now seems to own it. If you would like to see REAL reviews of Hair Effects, please visit Facebook or Square!,2014-09-19,dsOYxROX8LUI0yo8nLCTZg

I explained this to her nail tech multiple times but he just didn't understand anything I said and no one helped him. She ended up with blue and red ties with a bunny on her big toe. Nothing says patriotism like a bunny!?!  My toes have more polish on them then my nails do. They offered to fix them but honestly. No thanks.

mN0bCGteXHDpUzH2xqrABQ,I liked the cupcakes the last times I bought from here, but the most recent time was unfortunately a disappointment.    I'm not sure if it was just a bad day. The cupcakes were good, however, the icing was not up to par.  It was not good buttercream, dry, and had a sugary artificial taste.  Im ok with the expense of cupcakes, but I just expect them to really be quality.  Great flavors though, and really cute.   I would go back to see if it was a one off, or if I should go elsewhere from now on,2016-03-13,Ysa0V2BG3bGF-nAxVt1Orw

mpG1R1ktTI3x1twNBsGvXQ,The food is great as well as the prices. However, if they are going to advertise that this restaurant is ""good for kids"" it's probably in their best interest to pay more attention to the music that they are playing. Every song that came on while I was here kept dropping the F bomb among many other curse words. It may have just been a one time fluke, but the restaurant was full of kids and I bet their parents didn't appreciate such inappropriate music being played around their children.,2017-02-07,8fZ-kM7MlEjSH6Dmvomsbg

Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,If you're a fan of Lotus of Siam, or Thai food in general, I encourage you to try this spot asap. Although both places have excellent food, you cannot beat the attentive and personalized service at Table Thai. Additionally, their prices for savory dishes like Mango Salmon, BBQ Chicken, and fresh rolls (to name a few) are more than reasonable. It's truly a welcoming atmosphere, and continues to exceed my expectations every time.,2017-02-15,mEL1TNGLCS8qfRzMVijtjQ

PN1k_53s-BsSSmMU2KIIzw,I haven't been to Fit Factory, but I've worked out with Tony A. many times. I feel like some reviews based on a single class that portray him as being almost mean are not totally accurate. He's very tough, but not a bad guy at all.  I was intimidated by the yelling at first, but really he's trying to help you have the best workout possible. After a couple of classes I was hooked. As we got to know him, we learned just how warm and funny he is. We were so sad when he left that gym!,2015-11-05,xjre9hfTcMzZU1B6BwvWoA

51-j6MOP2NvVQo6y1bYuxQ,I love this place! They brew a complex selection of Meads in addition to some fantastic porters, ales, pilsners and Belgium style beers. Part of the reason I like The Bottle House Brewery so much is because they have a huge selection of Meads for those of us that have to be gluten-free.  Thumbs up!!!,2016-12-24,WXHnt5btifihaZdGI6ztQg
51-j6MOP2NvVQo6y1bYuxQ,If that were not enough already I discovered more GREAT news last night... almost ALL of their beers on tap are gluten-free with the addition of that special enzyme that removes gluten to a level that is good for some celiac people and most gluten intolerant people.   WHHHHAAAT!!   I was so excited to enjoy a fabulous dark sour last night and their coffee stout.   Thumbs up!!!!,2016-12-24,WXHnt5btifihaZdGI6ztQg

J2GTY3N_nH7d4L7ngCWKsw,THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!! The service is the best the waitress is really patient with you and the food is fresh, LITERALLY you get to pick the fresh fish and they give big portions and its really cool place to chill with friends and family.,2015-03-21,Ui7dQsKP7_KydndI8LdtSQ
J2GTY3N_nH7d4L7ngCWKsw,I'm pretty sure this place is a front for some sort of money-laundering operation. Every time I've eaten here, it has taken SO incredibly long to get our food that I am convinced that this place could not possibly stay in business if there wasn't something illegal going on. That said, the food is quite good. Fresh fish and salad, tasty fries. The staff disappears for long periods of time, presumably to cook the food, so you may have to wait a while to pay. Used to be BYOB, but sadly not anymore.,2017-10-21,86MaRC-2a09mSgI-FMrhrA

The food is also quite good but unfortunately, all of that loses its charm against the poor service we received.  The place was nowhere near full and our server was not the only one on the floor, so I have no idea what the issue was.   Our water was never replenished, our dishes were never cleared (we had to clear them on our own onto an adjacent table) and we could never find out server when we needed one.,2016-07-25,PQ3a95GBtuVVfCr3beBFSA

y6QP5IrOJ7_FsB51jN2_Jg,For a monthly lunch with friends I chose Pizza Rock at GV Ranch. I'd been there before (always getting the eggplant parmigiana) but this time went with a seasonal special...sweet potato pizza with marscapone cheese, pancetta & other stuff. Delicious! (I also took home the eggplant parmigiana). Not only was the food great but the server, Tony, managed to handle four rowdy senior ladies with ease, precision & friendliness! Thanks Tony!,2017-10-18,axKL0K040sC1ihD0aqZGfw

fXScQNUXwoUS2TgRFr8NjA,After every 15-30 mins, take the coals off of the top with the tong you get with your sheesha, and place it on the metal plate. Tap it a few times to take the ash off. When satisfied, place it back on top. Alternatively, just call their sheesha guy, and he'll fix it fast. If the smoke or favour is too strong for you, their sheesha guy is kind enough to fix it for you.,2015-08-08,0GoKje_Vqa269NcR-NoY7g

mW52SIegbJ3G5GcAB1H9-A,The store is packed to the gills, you cannot find anything, it is visually overwhelming. And the customer service is appalling. The people that work there act like they did you a favor by opening up the store for business. I will not be taking my business there again. There are many other consignment shops in the Madison area that have better quality. And any shred of decency would be better customer service.,2016-05-14,FgtkfpHZ7MQw2tRQ9S-bsg
mW52SIegbJ3G5GcAB1H9-A,If you're interested in shopping or consigning, bear in mind that the price the buyer pays gets split 50\/50 with the store (standard consignment, from my experience consigning handmades). So if you're getting a $200 Tahari suit for $100, the original owner only gets $50 and the store only gets $50. This seems like a fair deal to me, but your mileage may vary.,2017-11-16,YemLa23x0x0LHmFWM_haGg
azHkCTTMfAWDM0KNp5wqzw,Just went up to the bar to ask for a menu as we have been seated for a while and had no one address us and was answered with: ""I can't talk to you now, I'm making a cocktail"". The barman proceeded to talk to his colleague the whole time (so evidently he can multitask) and it wasn't until another barman came and offered his service that I was able to get a menu. Unimpressed. The food has yet to be tasted but hopefully it's better than this idiot's attitude.,2016-03-24,0ooBZWQC7E9eXBqo0jS9mA
azHkCTTMfAWDM0KNp5wqzw,They serve food until later than most other places. (At least until 11p everywhere else around here seems to stop at 10p). Also in case you're wondering where all the whisky's are, they have a drink menu, and then a separate whisky menu.,2017-09-10,OPsKWy8t13CDQDttNuBeMw
