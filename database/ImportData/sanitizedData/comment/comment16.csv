I asked her if I could sit on the seat. Every thing else was fine until I washed my hair to realized one side of my hair is longer than the other and she missed a few strands of hair.

hZAxcfDnLOkFY6G5ofI2RQ,I have been to every ""top tier"" doughnut place in the Las Vegas valley, and I can assure you this is the best doughnut shop in town. I have never even seen a blueberry fritter anywhere else, their caramel covered cinnamon roll is to die for when they warm it up for you, and they are one of only two places that even have white cream filling available as an option. I don't care for that Bavarian cream or Boston cream. I will drive 12 miles one way for this place.,2014-05-31,5G-Qua-1NywCbHWskRtiUw,
olmCDBoMF-EhN8U2livBSg,I have given them two chances to make a good tasting cake. But their cakes, both icing and the actual cake itself, just lack sweetness and flavor. All of my guests agreed at the last gathering, that cake was the worst we've ever had. We threw most of it away. When you have to throw away cake with kids around, something is wrong.   Both times I have purchased their cakes, they've been like this. I thought the first time was a fluke, but no. I must find a new custom cake shop now. :(,2017-07-07,5G-Qua-1NywCbHWskRtiUw,

dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA,The ordering process is ridiculous because you can't see a menu (they don't have a big one on the wall) until you get right up to the register to order. That really slows the process down because nobody has had a chance to decide until they are pressured to hurry up so they don't hold everyone up. Otherwise great place.,2015-05-21,5G-Qua-1NywCbHWskRtiUw,
odRsHBbIqljttG7TJzTIvA,This place rocks. They keep it simple, large scoops, plenty of toppings, and despite being in a casino, their prices are as reasonable as any ice cream shop I have been to in Vegas. Awesome!,2015-05-13,5G-Qua-1NywCbHWskRtiUw,
lVfZ2AaYRYHCFenUMQna8g,They have been closed for some time now due to a kitchen fire. They were originally supposed to reopen on May 1st, but keep pushing the date back. Their lack of accurate communication and information is unprofessional, with the only communication being a written sign on the door that keeps getting re-edited. But I can't wait for them to reopen. :),2015-05-20,5G-Qua-1NywCbHWskRtiUw,

mh9_KtSt_ebl7vTKiy2vQw,They changed the ""parking area"" and moved it just over a half mile back from where you used to be able to park, which is totally unnecessary of course, so just be forewarned. It adds just over an extra mile to your hike, assuming you have a high clearance vehicle and know where to find the trailhead to begin with. It can be tricky.,2015-05-03,5G-Qua-1NywCbHWskRtiUw,

Good thing is the orders were made right. HOWEVER, the cheese on the nachos was just enough to cover 4 chips. WTF!!!! and I had to take my 3 tacos and use the meat and cheese and lettuce to make one taco.  Obviously the is an issue with portion control.  I have eaten at taco bell for 20 + years.

TyZnv8aX1OJfBKoyuYgZLQ,Ok,  so i have been craving a reuben for about 6 months.  I have been to 9 different restaurants in search of an authentic Reuben sandwich!  A place that makes their own sauerkraut, cornbeef and 1000 island dressing.  I'm pretty sure this is the closest I have come so far.  The reuben I had was as close to perfect as it gets...  It is well balanced in flavor, I just wish it had about 2-3 oz more meat on it. Other then that it was perfect!!,2014-12-20,Pl1YRXDibRLFADVH2hTx7A,
TyZnv8aX1OJfBKoyuYgZLQ,The burgers, are best.  Yakuza burger make sure to add a fried egg. I'm hitting up the reuben again with some grill artichoke hearts....mmmmm!,2015-03-08,Pl1YRXDibRLFADVH2hTx7A,

3xykzfVY2PbdjKCRDLdzTQ,We went there on a sunday night at 6:30 pm.  The restaurant was about 25% occupied.  The service was extremely bad 10 min to seat us. 45 min to get our first roll then they all came at one time. Which is fine because of how hungry we were. Be prepared to track your waiter down food was about a 5.5 out of 10. Sushi was very average. If..we come back it will only be to try there Teppanyaki. Not to impressed!!,2013-12-22,Pl1YRXDibRLFADVH2hTx7A,

xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w,Tom Colicchio definitely deserves to be the head judge of Top Chef. Portions here are huge. If you come here for 2, just share the wagyu skirt steak & get 2 of the half portion sides (corn & risotto is highly recommended over the potato puree). The 24hour braised beef is OK. Lobster bisque is a little salty. The fresh bread is pretty good too. Monkey brain dessert is OK. Very sweet & the caramel coating will stick to your teeth.,2014-08-31,mgxklzhLAXHSgXUYAcqrWA,

r_BrIgzYcwo1NAuG9dLbpg,Food takes forever. Didn't get water until after 25min being seated. Pad Thai was surprisingly good. The curry in coconut shell is alright.

2mdF-c66TY3eSyTVI4GhQg,A little expensive for ice cream sandwich  ($8). The bakesale ice cream is pretty good. Smores cookies got too hard when put together with ice cream. Snicker doodle cookie is good,2017-01-05,mgxklzhLAXHSgXUYAcqrWA,
5ma1OUQWy_Ds80xUiP7JPQ,Jazz fries reminds me of poutine (replace curd cheese with fuku Crack sauce) & definitely worth the upgrade. Tamago burger is more special (but a little sweet) than buta which only adds bacon, not Japanese braised pork. Kinoko with mushroom is supposed to be pretty good. Fuku is ordinary. If you tip then, you'll get a jelly stick *lol*,2017-01-05,mgxklzhLAXHSgXUYAcqrWA,

9uRrzqQaq9XwW9lLj7oBxw,First time to this branch and loved it.The place was jam packed but still got satisfactory service. But the big difference to other IHOP branches I have been to,here in las vegas is the quality and taste of the food.Kudos to the cooks.The food tasted like actual food. I was afraid to go inside since the previouse branches Ive been to (marylndprkwy, rainbow) had aweful tasting food. From a bland biscuit and gravy to a watery pancake syrup.Definitely coming back to this branch,2013-03-22,YHy7WtLL3v9Ww801Rta0VA,

dJR2vmBlydzsxR5P6BDFlQ,Rubio's is amazing and I have to admit they have the best fish tacos. Even better than actual restaurants that try to ""fluff"" up their tacos with salsas and condiments. All you need is a corn tortilla and some lettuce, that's it. The blackened Mahi burrito is delicious too. Baja rules!!,2013-06-27,1-odnpMCU9Mo_RU97M5xmw,
A3A06nZ1zuiYbAuUDYsAVA,I've been coming back to this smoke shop for years now. Honestly they have the best deals in town on glass pipes. For $10 I bought a pipe that would easily sell for $20 anywhere else.,2013-07-22,1-odnpMCU9Mo_RU97M5xmw,

gtB-1QxTscdPj78UE5sWuQ,Free PBR with check in! Furthermore, the Black and Bleu salad is a delicious combination of sliced steak, bleu cheese, slow roasted tomatoes, and crispy onion rings. P.S. Clam appetizer (Clams in white wine sauce), will melt your face off.,2013-09-17,1-odnpMCU9Mo_RU97M5xmw,
2hyciWHsqnbqdEkUvO3KuQ,Best fish and chips in town. Leave it to the British to come correct with the fish 'n chips. Their whole menu is amazing. Try the meat pies and British burger with Stilton cheese(kinda like blue cheese but milder).,2013-07-13,1-odnpMCU9Mo_RU97M5xmw,

ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,Hesitant to come here because of the ""you know what"", but I used to be an avid fan. It was mundane this last visit. Most the dishes were over powered by one ingredient that masked the protein\/main ingredient. The shrimp Al Arjillo was mostly lemon flavored, however the shrimp was properly cooked exceeding Southern Nevada health code standards.,2013-07-21,1-odnpMCU9Mo_RU97M5xmw,
VFXKmRqMw1UX852ARt4rhA,First time here. The Acai smoothie was very tasty and energizing. The coffee smells really good so I will be back to try a mexi-mocha.,2013-09-13,1-odnpMCU9Mo_RU97M5xmw,

Before you get a massage there, take your cheap broke ass to Coinstar so that tip isn't an issue. 2. Don't pay for the luxury of getting a $20 massage. 3. I guess you guys have never worked in the service industry where your income is mostly tips. 4. If you ain't got money take your broke ass home. Good day. :],2014-09-30,wcpH1pP0DCJvPKe5tjGopg,
