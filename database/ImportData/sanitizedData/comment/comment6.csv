iJw_eNKLuCXCQmXIuhgLXw,The cleaners have no control over scheduling, price or charges. They also get charged for cancellations. As for the rating system, that's how they decide how much to pay the cleaners. Not really fair since the cleaners pay for their own supplies, gas and time. Unless the cleaner does a horrible job, leave a 5 rating. The cleaners must be even more frustrated than us.

PQjzypTSXDUG0NNSXcASvQ,Uber drivers can never find this place!!  How hard is it?  Here's the solution: If you're tired of Lyft and Uber drivers getting lost or not knowing their way around the gayborhood, try Fare, enter SUE1 as referral code.  Give your own code out and every time your referrals ride you get free ride credits.  Adding my code puts me on your preferred driver list so you can request me directly!

fdkJsDiy27e4Ragp27MMhg,Make sure that your pin drops correctly.  Location detection isn't perfect, tap the compass or arrow in the top or bottom right side of your screen to refresh your location.  Otherwise you could be sending a driver to an incorrect location.,2016-06-21,Ym1rvBpth5aajR-rK6xYzw,
fdkJsDiy27e4Ragp27MMhg,Tip your driver.  Uber takes 25-28% from your total, so drivers who tell you they make bank are lying.,2016-06-21,Ym1rvBpth5aajR-rK6xYzw,
fdkJsDiy27e4Ragp27MMhg,Try Fare instead.  It's so much better. You can schedule rides and pick your driver.  They don't jack up the prices either. Download the app and enter SUE1 as referral ID.,2016-06-21,Ym1rvBpth5aajR-rK6xYzw,

After the show I told the bouncer\/doorman that I had free rides for their intoxicated patrons to get home safely using Lyft.

aKFA85Miwb96A0IAS3mRgQ,I've stopped in a few times to the new location now and have tried a few things I hadn't before. Let's start with the bad: the Gyro Bowl. I was expecting more of a side gyro type dish with some veggies mixed in. What I got was a salad with just a little bit of gyro meat. Disappointing. And now for the good: the chicken fingers, a Wednesday special, may be just that, chicken fingers, but they are gooooood. And the side of sweet potato fries are delicious and plentiful.,2015-02-18,sTAAPSkBP_6zxpajW40bHw,
fTQra2F9uRDzgDWTaVe1yg,Just like the aquarium, this place needs to expand for the price of it's admission. Either that, or they should cut it in half. It's off to a good start though and like the aquarium, I see a lot of potential. The kids had fun.,2016-06-07,sTAAPSkBP_6zxpajW40bHw,

fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg,FYI: if your food comes out late or not right, it is not because of the servers, but the cooks! The servers there are great. But the cooks, one female and one male, got 4 orders wrong in the 45 minutes I was there sitting at the bar eating! They don't read what the servers put on the paper or speak an ounce of English! At first I thought it was the server being rude to the cooks but if my tips depended on the cooks reliability to dish out correct food on time, I'd be irritated at them too!,2013-11-20,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
kblFxfo_xnMUZF0U0aGXQw,Come in with expectations that the service will suck and you won't have a problem dining here.,2016-04-12,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
LjCrhp_Rys2bCIJHz5EGBA,They love talking shit. If you walk in this place you are basically giving free reign to the 2 ladies that are always here to make fun of you in Chinese. And they know how to bicker without staring at you or blatantly laughing. Everytime I come here I pretend I don't know their language and listen as they talk mad shit about me, how much I eat, when will I leave... they will make fun of anyone especially fat people and black people. It's sad how disrespectfully rude they are.,2016-12-06,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA,The sauce for the orange beef is great. The beef they use tho is a bit too chewy for my liking. My mouth was too tired of chewing before I got full. Also ask for a knife because the pieces are rather large for your mouth! They have great fast service!,2013-09-13,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
lUXialmIbkqIav0URIXxPQ,This review is for the strippers: this is the only club I know that turns on heat instead of ac inside so you are constantly sweating just standing on stage! Wtf?! Also their pole is a cheap pole that is much too slippery to do pole tricks on so you are stuck with solely floor work. Theres better...,2012-12-27,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
XvTBQotmJpVPjPNaMM7qLA,If they could just provide better customer service and get my order right just half the time I would be a regular customer. Food is good. Their employees are not.,2013-01-09,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
UY13CTgUqriT-fMxT2APLw,I did not enjoy their duck pho. It ruined pho for me. Didnt try other pho but if it tastes at all like their duck pho it is not good. They put some different weird spice in it unusual to normal pho places. It has forever ruined the taste of pho for me and I am not happy about this at all.,2013-01-03,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,The portions are ridiculously tiny for a bowl! If hungry, I could eat two bowls. Veggies and noodles are cheap, they don't have to be as stingy as they are about the amount of food they put in. They don't even fill the bowl up all the way.,2013-01-01,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
BbGs3XK0x9NEImer3LQD3w,Most these girls don't know how to dance. There's not even a fuckin stripper pole in this club!,2012-07-13,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
ITRBrOOVQJEgc5dbxV1Bbw,This place is pretty bomb. Not what I expected at all! Open 24\/7. Good sweet horchata. Street fighter arcade game. Only complaint is the whole place smells like a banos!,2012-12-20,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,

Noi53T0PWNEN9mQRS3-Ncg,Dlish's mission statement boasts ""we offer organic and all natural fresh ingredients..."" While very noticeably showcases a large jar of blue (not even the brown ""all natural"") skippy's peanut butter on their coffee counter. I still love the food here and come here often, but their claims for organic and natural are not to be trusted!!!,2013-09-29,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,

yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw,They are stingy on the rice which is a real let down. Prepare to pay extra for more if you are coming with a party of 2 or more!,2015-04-23,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
J07TDs6qnTIaxm48EL1cKQ,The new older woman bartender that recently got hired or recently started working morning shifts sucks. She is constantly on her phone even when I walked directly up to her. I can't believe management hired a person like this! Really dampened down their great work crew. :(,2015-12-03,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
-Oj_rs84KRFOTtbeQXPB7Q,When asked about any entree, the waitress literally said ""I'm sorry, I don't know Korean food.""  WTF REALLY?! Does this girl even know what type of establishment she works in?! Mind blown.,2015-11-25,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
oWboXKe_xk6Vcr2gBEuxuw,Great pasta cooked al dente and to order for 5 bucks! Owner is very nice. Check out his wife's thrift boutique next door while you wait for the pasta to cook! Also all their pastas are preservative free!,2013-01-23,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
IRnQNbsjgVjW28YYiZcJJA,worst gas station ever!! I gave them 35 In cash for gas and they charged me for only 30 dollars in gas! I went back to tell them and had to wait 15 mins for the dumbass cashiers to count their drawers to realize the mistake!,2013-01-28,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ,There was only one young server guy there and all tables were slammed. He did a great job keeping a house full of ppl happy. Food came fast and is on the saltier side... Overall, This place is great!,2013-01-22,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ,They have a small kitchen. Don't come here expecting a fast meal. Wait time is about 30 mins sometimes longer for any dish, even appetizers. But the food is good.,2013-11-23,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA,Fyi the amount of soup\/sauce you get with your meat entrees can be inconsistent and sometimes when they don't give you enough,  you will have to ask for more and when you do they charge you $2 and sometimes $1. Wtf. Sometimes you get jipped and what can you do?!?!.... :(,2015-03-17,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
S6TMBqrsi4PLRFoQFPScjQ,The interior of this place is nice and clean! The bowls aren't too filling but decent. Salads are a decent size. The crab puffs taste nothing like crab. Just vegan cream cheese deep fried in a cracker. Didnt like that.,2013-09-26,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
-jKBFjNTbiafSdunQy6dlQ,Their fried rice here is neon orange in color. And I'm pretty sure they aren't using turmeric or saffron! Do you trust orange fried rice?,2013-12-07,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
enpKzY7zZqV_DGFBn-Saag,Overpriced. Enough said. But their sale items are only 2 bucks!,2012-08-21,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
b5epWgPoVcXoMJdCCzFMUw,The food here is not filling at all. I had a full panini sandwich and half a serving of soup and left still hungry but tired, and unsatisfied.,2014-01-08,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
Ld2hhA3q3cdkptwS1fsYEg,Chicken beef and veggies are great. Sushi sucks,2013-10-11,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,

DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q,They only fill the soup bowl up just a little bit over half way... It's not a lot! Also if u don't want the fried tortilla strips in there (they put a lot in) remember to ask for them on the side.,2013-11-24,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg,There's an Asian girl who works here with the most irritating loud voice ever. Opt to eat outside when she works. You will thank me!,2014-09-17,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,This place tastes like straight up butter. It's a good place to go eat for fat people trying to gain more weight.,2014-09-28,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
1jpYP-JNOEYCMIzP4OlGuQ,They are a more salty buttery version of chipotle.,2014-09-28,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
qnyTJ39UXke3aAS0gdWsww,This would be my favorite whole foods if they would just fix the annoying air\/wind that blows everytime someone walks through the door by the dining area, or just permanently close that entrance\/exit completely. If you sit there for more that 15 minutes at peak shopping hours you will understand!!!,2013-12-17,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
xdphjWZymq-3dqOWmA_wwA,The food here is great if you can get past the language barrier. Food arrives quickly but don't expect good service here. Their stinky tofu is not the best I've had but edible.,2013-09-28,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ,That fat kid worker is so rude! I poked a straw thru my boba like normal and the wrapper exploded and spilled on me. I asked for a napkin cuz there's never any at the counter. He gets frustrated and says I poked it too hard. Who the fuck cares if I did anyways?! Ur customer is now wet! He then says to hold on when I ask for a napkin while I soak in juice cuz he was making a drink!,2014-10-08,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
mwteIVYDMKxe1Z7QQixz3Q,Also, the front desk girl working that day was rude and did not listen nor care to try to understand what I was saying. I got screamed at by her which was extremely unprofessional and disturbed the customer behind me waiting to be adjusted. Under no situation should an employee scream at a customer.,2015-05-31,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
5OZS7Sz7oX6XBL7KZE0G1Q,Their chicken soup that comes with the lunch special is made with actual real chicken (granted it is just cheap ground chicken). But most establishments are lazy and use bouillon cubes to make soup. This place does not! Their soups are legit!,2016-01-13,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
9VKXdVbyHM5CyGmMffWKnQ,I wish they would put more emphasis on their food than how aesthetically pleasing their place is to the eyes. What's  the point of a good looking place when the food doesn't compare? :\/,2015-07-08,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,
9VKXdVbyHM5CyGmMffWKnQ,From the exterior, this place looks like what a restaurant opened by whole foods would look like. Very nice large outdoor patio looks inviting!,2014-12-13,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,

RvG07zPC9O_g9GXA5Lt9gQ,Their teas are a little watery and lack the taste of tea. Tastes like I'm just drinking sugary milk. But their boba is on point,2016-09-20,ZoaGfcb5U1RCZhBXpHYJBg,

zOL260xaXDYZZPBItzALxQ,A very quaint establishment. They serve Thrifty brand ice cream. It's good, but not the best. However, they have a full service, with a plethora of syrup varieties, bar specializing in sundry ice cream, shake, and soda dishes.

pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,Cibo's pizzas are superior. I had to wait around three hours (!) to get in here and, though their pizzas are very good, they were soaked in olive oil. This place is definitely overrated. Cibo's has a better atmosphere, variety, and quality of food.,2012-05-28,UUFlYsoKWKSvBtUWUAg3Jg,

7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ,Solidly tasty pizzas and breakfast items. Their food is a little on the pricey side. The biggest problem is the Scottsdale crowd that frequents this place and exudes a snobby and supercilious air.,2012-05-28,UUFlYsoKWKSvBtUWUAg3Jg,

Their tacos are their especially and are yummy. I don't like their carne asada burritos, however; meat is tough.,2012-05-27,UUFlYsoKWKSvBtUWUAg3Jg,

TtpRhu-Lts9MzGrnllWuRA,You always have to follow up with management and show them proof of the issues you need fixed. Do not let them forget about you.,2014-09-20,t1Pu9qUa0oID7Hasa-D__g,
TtpRhu-Lts9MzGrnllWuRA,I would recommend not using the laundry facility at night or at all if you can help it. It is filthy and overpriced and good luck refilling your card if you are not there before the office closes. Aside from that, the washers brake down all the time and the dryers are inefficient.  I have gone to do my laundry on multiple occasions and have had to wait for hours while the entire facility is in use and more than 4 washers are out of order. They do not have enough units for a complex this size.,2014-09-20,t1Pu9qUa0oID7Hasa-D__g,
TtpRhu-Lts9MzGrnllWuRA,Never park in any covered spots because people will tow your car within 30 minutes of it being there.,2014-09-20,t1Pu9qUa0oID7Hasa-D__g,
TtpRhu-Lts9MzGrnllWuRA,They say this is a gated community but the entry gates are always open and people either jump the fences or force open the back entry way to gain access anyway. But the biggest threat to safety is not the fences always being open its the gangs of unsupervised children throwing rocks, breaking windows, putting rocks in gas tanks and destroying facilities with no consequences.,2014-09-20,t1Pu9qUa0oID7Hasa-D__g,
TtpRhu-Lts9MzGrnllWuRA,Get used to trash being everywhere in the parking areas and people digging through the trash dumpsters in the mornings.,2014-09-20,t1Pu9qUa0oID7Hasa-D__g,
TtpRhu-Lts9MzGrnllWuRA,If you bring up issues with the staff, be wary of doing it too much, I reminded the man in the office of what he said about the laundry room door lock and he decided the best way to reply was with a snarky comment. Unprofessional, and honestly I wish he wasn't always the person who seems to be there to help me whenever I go in. Not that the rest of the management team has that great an attitude anyway. Just be careful of what you say to them if you want them to treat you nicely.,2016-10-27,t1Pu9qUa0oID7Hasa-D__g,
TtpRhu-Lts9MzGrnllWuRA,There is still a problem with people digging through the trash and even when told about it, the management seems reluctant to actually do anything about it. I have reported incidents to them and have even sat and waited to see if they take care of it, but they never do. I have started alerting the police to the people going through the garbage in an attempt to help. This is an area with families and young children don't need to be exposed to that type of thing.

yKphJNeSiBLPDxVHiLuklA,Dr. Ramin Sebahi was the first Rheumatologist I could get in to see so quickly.  This office is near 24th & Van Buren. I can't lie... At first, that concerned me! But, I was pleasantly surprised with the interior of the building and the service. In addition, I was most impressed by the time, patience, knowledge and care Dr. Sebahi displayed with me. He included me in treatment and explained the information to me clearly. The resident was also Excellent! She was very engaged and thorough!,2013-07-19,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
77b5UIJLRJTYjekpTxNPfw,This is the best church in the valley! Bishop Thomas makes Scripture easy to understand. He's a natural comedian and keeps services interesting! It is on the larger side...there are well over 4, 000 members. There is an East Valley location in addition to this location. The Phx location has 2 levels to accommodate all of the people. I began going here over 10 years ago. This was the 1st church that made me want to keep coming back! I'd highly recommend it to everyone! Don't believe the Hype!,2013-04-07,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,

VGeEZARjbkDhrS18z5nF7w,These guys do a pretty good job. Make sure to double check your car before leaving. If you have a luxury vehicle, they are used to dealing with these type of cars. They usually give them a little extra attention.,2012-10-22,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
dHTGzM4_3kKEiQvab9mi9A,I had forgotten about this place! They have great food. We got the Hunan beef, Shrimp fried rice, hot & sour soup and an order of pot stickers. All very good!,2013-03-28,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
dHTGzM4_3kKEiQvab9mi9A,I forgot to check in but I'm leaving a tip. I love Panda Garden! Today, we got the Mongolian Beef (great flavor!), Lo Mein (hint of garlic)  House Fried Rice with tender pieces of chicken,  beef, pork and big pieces of Shrimp, Sweet n Sour Chicken, pot stickers and Hot & Sour Soup. Everything was amazing. My only drawback is the Hot Sour Soup is a bit sweet. It's good but I prefer P.F. Changs. Also, the server was very friendly & accomodating. Overall, we were very pleased! We will be back soon,2013-04-22,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,

bPltdYohPqJBqBbldsV48Q,The customer service is top notch at this Pier 1 Imports! They greet each person as you walk through the door and ask if there is anything in particular you are looking for. If you have something in mind they will take you over and make suggestions.  They have some great decorating ideas! Carla is my favorite! I'd give them 5 stars!,2013-03-19,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,

snP8QGxG-YRNBL_uq1kiAQ,Brandon was all by himself today running Jamba Juice. I must say he did a great job! Actually even better than when the newbies are there to help our! He was courteous and had a smile on his face although, I'm sure he felt a bit overwhelmed. He made sure to acknowledge each person that walked through the door and let them know he would be with them shortly.  5 Stars Brandon!,2013-04-22,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
snP8QGxG-YRNBL_uq1kiAQ,Brandon is back!!! I tell ya the service is night and day without him! He is hands down the best employee Jamba has!! Outside of the awesome Smoothies....

snP8QGxG-YRNBL_uq1kiAQ,I must say that I have been blown head over heels with how Clayton and Jordan have impressed me the last few times I've come in to Jamba. First off, they're smiling as soon as I walk through the door. They have memorized my name as well as my entire favorite order!! Also, to top it off we have had some of the best morning conversations to start my day! Five stars guys!! You All Keep Me Coming Back! This is what great service is truly about,2013-05-20,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,

OAWBoum2byFC-GfARO2bfQ,They really need to have more open lines especially at night! Their prices are great but service is to be desired. But, what can I say...It's Walmart! Lol,2013-04-01,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
OAWBoum2byFC-GfARO2bfQ,I'm not particularly the biggest fan of Walmart, however, they do have some great prices on certain items. It's just strategically picking the best times to go to avoid the mass crowds of people and the 2 open registers!!!,2013-05-13,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
OAWBoum2byFC-GfARO2bfQ,The 24 hour Walmart is a great idea! I would highly recommend against going to Walmart late at night. There are just not enough cashiers to compensate the amount of customers. It would be helpful for Walmart to keep some of the self-service lanes open late at night...with supervision. I could understand the risks. You can get better prices on certain food items like chips, cereal, bread, condiments, salad dressings, eggs, Jennie-O Turkey Burgers, Lean Cuisine, Smart Ones, Juice, butter etc...,2013-09-25,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
h8ZB8cLiPo3x2f1fZr7e-A,Grabbing a quick bite to eat. A beef and cheddar sandwich sounded pretty good! The service at this particular Arby's isn't the best. They lack professionalism and basic customer service skills. I think it's ironic that they have a sign on the window that says honk if your service was great. I bet it's really quiet over here!,2013-04-20,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,

uOJ87zqbU1MtShCSHDkiyw,I meant to check in when I was here for my birthday dinner and party on Friday Oct. 11th  I absolutely loved the ambience and the food! Oh, let me not forget about the live band Contreband they were Amazing! We had such a great time! We will start making regular visits to Va Bene's. My only drawback s were that they took a really long time to bring our food out to the table. Also, the specials that aren't on the menu are approximately $40 a plate..they are delicious but just be prepared!,2013-10-17,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
ydhgMcBh4A_eihzEAg9LLQ,You must try a double-double! It's the best burger in town! Lines are typically long but it's definitely worth the wait.

HhFsbbmmEg6vgjXnRJ70HQ,This McDonald's has very long lines in the morning between 6:30am-8:30am. So, if you're in a rush it may be a good idea to try one of the other McDonald's in the area or come outside of the morning rush hour. They're pretty courteous and friendly.,2014-01-16,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
togzltbV52oGR-a0jddqZw,I love this place! Kim is the best! She does great nail art & amazing eyebrows!  They do the best pedicures! I like the VIP Spa which includes a warm sugar scrub, a raw earth super hydrating aroma therapy masque treatment,  paraffin wax, plus a hot rock massage all which leave my skin really soft! It's an upscale, warmly decorated nail spa. This location is in Ahwatukee.  So, it's a little more expensive but definitely worth it!,2013-04-01,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
togzltbV52oGR-a0jddqZw,I go to the Ahwatukee location and they are great here! Especially, Kim...she does the best nail art and pedicures! She also does really good eyebrows! The VIP Spa Pedicure is my favorite! Try the gel nails they last a for almost a month.,2013-04-22,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,

maGqjGXYPzal3YydKu8wjQ,I typically go to this Panda Express because it's on my route home & it's one of my daughter's favs! The service is hit or miss. It's seem to be like the forbidden word to come here and order Pot Stickers. Every time I order them they tell me they don't have them. Then, when I ask if they still carry pot stickers because they are on the menu! Their response is they just don't have any made & it will be a 5-10 minute wait. So, I always I'll wait.,2013-04-10,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
zLLheOiDzAaKenh333ZuQQ,Elrie is The Best Pharmacist at Any CVS I've ever been to! I no longer live closest to this CVS. But after going to the others that are closer to my house they paled in comparison to the outstanding service I receive here (Especially from Elrie). She remembers special details about me, always remembers my name, is always so helpful and is always smiling! Her service definitely makes me drive the extra miles because she does the same! Love her!,2013-04-16,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,

It's a zoo trying to get in and out of there right now so this was the next best option.,2013-04-16,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,

u6xb2aUAvX6i1WhsQWqgWg,The wait here is kind of on Sundays,  mostly because of the after church crowd. So it may be a good idea to go early on a Sunday and their hours prior to going. The food is definitely worth the wait! It is soul food and if you've never had it, this is a great place to start! Don't plan on sticking to your diet!,2013-05-19,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,

FiFDrJNeUUOL4_ADZNekjA,The selection of items and service are good. I come in here a lot because it's close to my house. But, they seem to have a bigger, better selection, as well as, customer service at the Ross on 48th St & Ray Rd-Ahwatukee. Also, I don't have people walking by me watching me as if I am stealing. Lol I just like to take my time and I can be horrible on making decisions. I guess I can see how that could come off as suspicious but I still don't like it! I'd give them 2.5 stars out of 5. Step it up!,2013-03-19,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
_BinpQSjqtEgycxQxKHIGg,Great new car wash by my house. It has great amenities! They have recliners for you to relax in while watching 1 of 6 flat screen tv's. They have a machine that makes shakes! In addition to these they have a full convenient store. My only issue was that the car wash attendant kept trying to up sell me on other things. I was already getting the Ultimate Plus which was $32.99. They did a nice job on my car. I must say better than most other places I've been to. Travis the cashier was excellent!,2013-03-19,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
_BinpQSjqtEgycxQxKHIGg,Cobblestone Auto Spa is my favorite new car wash. My second time here and this time I brought my sister to get her car washed too. It's a little pricey but well worth the money! They have 6 flat screen tv's to watch in one of the comfy leather recliners  They also have an internet cafe and game station at no additional cost. In addition, they have a convenient store with milkshake machines. Great service with luxury accommodations!,2013-04-21,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
K6aka0ybxG03lYWTG4MRIg,This is my first time at this Quick Trip. It is really big and super nice! It has a lot of items most other QT's don't have just yet. They even have a smoothie bar with smoothies, soft serve ice cream, pretzels & a whole array of pastries! The drinks are on separate sides of the store every kind of tea you can think of plus coffee! Then soft drinks and frozen drinks are on the other side. Lots of fresh food items that looked pretty good! I may just come here every now & then due to it's so nice!,2013-09-26,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,
Pg-KfFD3GcWDtJv5J3yvmw,I haven't been to this location in a couple of months. But, I didn't get the kind of Superior Starbucks Service that I'm accustomed to. The young lady seemed like I was disrupting her day by being there to order coffee. She didn't smile, greet me or even ask my name to put on my coffee cup as they normally would do although she didn't need to because it's on my Gold Starbucks card...hint hint I buy a lot of Starbucks Coffee. Despite all of that everyone else was great and so was my coffee!,2013-10-24,Wxdj4Zui4VgbMR4yvCERXw,

The office people lie and deceive you, one minute they said we don't play water then when I got the bill they changed it.Apartments are small and not well built. Also they charge you for a gate key gym key and many other fees if you want the extra things that should come free.Say they r just doing a credit check and not put it on your credit but do DONT STAY,2013-06-11,YnJ5oQ4dzpEIMjyT2hwVzA,
