Everywhere in a 10 mile radius was astronomical. I had taken my car in to Auto Care before & decided to give them another shot as my 1st experience was pleasant. While I still paid a lot, it was literally $300 less than the next cheapest quote I'd already gotten. I had my car back within 3 hours.

gX126w-SBfFvXfWekeb1SA,I bought my puppy from Kathryn after I made the mistake of buying my last puppy on Craigslist from people who claimed to be breeders and gave me a very sick puppy.  Going to Kathryn my main concern was a healthy dog and that's what I got! My Maltese is now over two years old and I've never had to take her to the vet. Kathryn helps with ANY questions I have and explains everything you need to know even years later. I would highly recommend buying from her if you want a beautiful healthy Maltese.,2014-03-29,pG-0fg0xNjjpWiFjAJN_pQ

She dresses  sleezy with her stomach showing.  This isn't  Tilted Kilt. I wish you would have  hired  a woman or man bartender that is more classy and not drawing that clientele.  I probably won't be coming as often.  Not happy  with your choice.,2017-05-03,205Hs9H46oFEpsF7B9eW2g

bijuzIymKtfSTy3Rl5t2_A,When I walked into Azteca Bridal my first thought was This place is definitely older, and does need an upgrade. I waited for about 8 minutes just to be noticed, finally someone helped me, and she smiled- but no handshake, no exchanged names. We went up stairs &immediately I was shocked by the variety. she was very helpful trying to help me find a dress. The young ladies who help you put on your dress r alot nicer!

UDucqwO8PwUOwcmUsJ-gOA,.. Very good food here .. Chicken cooked  to PERFECTION .. Seasoned nicely as well.  Don't waste your time ordering the tacos or burritos , just go for the half or whole chicken. It's cooked RIGHT.  The beans they serve are the business too. No rice is served here.  You couldn't be disappointed though with the pollo y frijoles  unless you are some sort of jive turkey .. I suggest to order to go ... Parking can get tricky too as the parking lot is rather narrow.,2013-04-11,OqjUpEmkBii2rna3r8JkQA

81PPqr6yS3DuiLeQDSpUgQ,Make sure you request a gate code if you plan to visit this complex.,2013-07-21,LTjtaa2tuAYWv17a93PVsA
81PPqr6yS3DuiLeQDSpUgQ,Maintenance team has still not fixed garage door that QA reported broken on July 3rd. Two months is far too long for delayed repairs. They say they are too busy fixing AC units... Perhaps some new AC units are in order, but since management does not pay for electric bills that would only benefit tenants, and who cares about them?,2013-09-07,LTjtaa2tuAYWv17a93PVsA
81PPqr6yS3DuiLeQDSpUgQ,This apartment complex and their management team seem to be ""selective"" in their response to maintenance and repair requests. I moved in July 2013 and as of April 2014 several repair orders that were approved at move-in have not been competed. A fairly major entry door frame and lock repair order approved in January has not yet been competed. Carpeting was worn out at move in and looks horrible. AC is marginal. Toilets are lowest quality I have ever seen, very third world!,2014-04-24,LTjtaa2tuAYWv17a93PVsA
81PPqr6yS3DuiLeQDSpUgQ,Management team is rude, inconsiderate and not interested in anything other than new leases, collecting money and evicting tenants who are 5 days past due on rent. I have now been here for two years and have assisted many tenants deal with this hostile management team. Maintenance crew is outstanding, location good, all appliances are the cheapest and least efficient models. Entrata second floor units are best due to their vaulted ceiling. Check sign photo - At 3:30 PM office was locked!,2015-01-11,LTjtaa2tuAYWv17a93PVsA
81PPqr6yS3DuiLeQDSpUgQ,This apartment complex has been sold by CompassRock to Tarantino... Residents do not know what to expect. At the end of 2016, it was announced that previous management, CompassRock would take over again on January 1, 2017.,2016-04-03,LTjtaa2tuAYWv17a93PVsA
81PPqr6yS3DuiLeQDSpUgQ,Check out the new multi-colored paint scheme for the exterior of these buildings... gives the complex a sort of Capitola, CA look. Parking still sucks because management does not do anything to prevent abuse and abandoned vehicles.,2016-11-01,LTjtaa2tuAYWv17a93PVsA

81PPqr6yS3DuiLeQDSpUgQ,If you want to be able to park anywhere close to your apartment, then don't select a unit near the front or main entry gate. By 8 PM on most weekdays the only available parking is in the very back rows of the complex. There are too many non-tenant cars parked here that haven't been moved in months.,2017-01-26,LTjtaa2tuAYWv17a93PVsA

YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,Deceptive. The yelp page says that they have happy hour, but then I'm told at the restaurant they're not doing it because it gonna be busy. The NAB show was going on, so any large convention makes it an unhappy hour. Too bad they will not honor that which they posted on their own yelp page. :(,2017-04-23,JNSGvptffWYASrsh0gPNog

zvGIVRj4QiAEK713_Rbz7Q,A very good tasting sandwich, soup was pretty good, chip bags were a lil tiny.

d1pB6SLzLb-4lFq8y5tEnQ,If you never got soon tofu soup before, it comes scalding hot (a couple degrees under boiling) and mild is very spicy by non Korean standards.   Be warned and order accordingly.,2014-08-21,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
Em0MDcxhSYZm7JVpR6WyJA,Cheesy and fun, I liked the dark gold mine which was slanted and difficult to walk straight.  The melodrama was cute and the kids liked the audience participation (boo, hiss, etc)  the shooting and hanging was kid appropriate and good.  The bathrooms by the goldmine were totally normal and clean, dont know what other reviewers were complaining about.  The petting area wasnt bad.  The place was old but sort of added to the charm.  Would come back, the kids loved it..,2013-12-31,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
SZ5KO1KNiwtrktKo5mpuLA,The calamari was chewy and a bit bkand.  The peking duck served 2 ways was great, so was the squab, satay beef with vermacelli was good and the pan fried noodles were very good.  The pea shoots with garlic was delicious!,2013-07-14,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw,The chipoltle chicken w\/avocado wss great.  The tomato bisque was so creamy and very godd -  came with croutons in the soup that were not soggy. The berry almond salad was just ok, as expected nothing special.,2013-12-28,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w

U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q,Loved rhe spicy Dan dan mein, the a-choy veggies with bits of fried anchovies was also delicious. The ja-jien noodle sauce was just ok.  The pan fried pork dumplings were very good.  So were the spicy garlic dumplings with chili oil. The pork and mushroom sauce was great.  The steamed dragon buns hit 3 of the 4 greatness markers: 1) juicy-VERY 2) thin skin-yes 3) meat tender and light-very 4) delicious taste-meh,2013-07-15,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q,Gamble enough to get a diamond card so you dont have wait :) !  Love the pan fried pork and chive dumplings - a must have!  They have fresh watermelon juice too! The shanghai wonton noodle soup was perfect for the kids.  They loved it! The xiao long bao was only ok (a bit too sweet). The ja jierng mein wasnt my fav. The sauce was lacking something. The A-choy veggie dish rocks, so yummy.  The dan dan mein rules,2013-12-26,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog,Pork loin was great but since I had to share, I dudnt get enough.  The wagyu tartar was good but slightly under salted.,2013-08-17,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
LR0qF0FEVsCOhYWUOiH26A,The tandoori oven naan was fresh from the oven and crispy and delicious.  My son said it was out of this world.  The salmon was perfectly seasoned and baked to the right temp. The caesar salad was well dresswd.  Overall, the 3 star rating seems a little low. The waitress we had wasnt too friendly.,2013-11-16,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg,The spaghetti with tomato and basil was incredible.  How can you make a simple dish so delic?  The carrots were great.  The artic char was phenomenal.

5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw,Because this place was originally built to be condos, it is the only casino where the rooms, check-in, and parking garage are all in the same place and you dont have to schlep your stuff across the casino to your room.  The functional terraces are awesome but beware weekend nights are noisy with the club downstairs,  even if you are on the 30th floor! Beautiful amenities are a plus, great for the hip crowd.,2013-12-29,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw,Oh and the coolest thing is that in the fitness center, there is a full boxing ring as well as  2 sand filled punching bags and you can ask for boxing gloves at the desk to either work out or go a few rounds with your friend or foe!,2014-06-11,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw,And another tip:  in the parking garage,  the red lights above mean that parking space is taken. Look for green lights for an open space.,2014-08-22,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w

K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg,Wow.  I thought the Bacchanal buffet couldn't be toped but it can!  The salad selection is great.  Some highlights:  the seafood paella-very fresh, bone marrow,  the chicken, quince bar, the five spice pork belly (for the flavor of the meat-the skin was actually too hard to eat), the nutella ice cream and the thai ice tea ice cream. The fruit selection was fresh. The Korean shortribs were too too chewy.,2013-08-15,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg,The Chinese broccoli was delicious, my favorites are:  bacon, greek salad, Caesar salad, apple crisp, spicy poached eggs,2013-12-27,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w

K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,Our table loved the lobster paella, the brussel sprouts, and the patatas bravas (potatoes).  The shrimp with garlic was ok. The different ebutidos all tasted very similar to me.  The fried pasta with squid in was good and so was the mushrooms. The french toast-like dessert was awes ok me,2013-11-16,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,The wonton noodle soup was ok.  The wontons were decent, the noodles just ok.,2013-12-29,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg,The smoked salmon tartar was delicious, wish there was more of it-not enough for 4 to share .  The Mediterranean seabass was everything the other reviewers said it would be .  The grilled octopus was great and the Milos fried zucchini and special with dip was amazing.  Kids and adults loved it.,2013-12-26,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
N8D-5-fW7EkBdKjNYGhu0A,The price fix dinner for New Year's eve was a bargain considering even chain restaurants in the area were charging the same price for theirs.  The salmon caviar vinaigrette was delicious. The shortribs and mustard greens were great but the pumpkin ravioli was a but too sweet an accompaniment.  The diver scallops were cooked perfectly, the beef Wellington although very tender and mushroomy, needed something, maybe some sherry.  The burger was amazing. The tiramisu was out of this world.,2013-12-31,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w
BnpuVvPy3sfLlkqKCx6Xnw,Bread was delicious! A cut-away loaf with a crisp top and a sipwe sodt center. The beef barley soup was a bit too salty. The tuscan salad was ok. A little too vinegary I think.,2013-08-18,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w

pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,New style sashimi is a must have.  The miso black cod is also a big hit with everyone.  We usually love the monkfish liver but the sauce this time was a bit too sweet and overpowering.  The roast veggies although good was way too tangy for half our table and the kids. The sticky rice with tuna was a crowd pleaser.  The chocolate lava cake bento box with green tea ice cream is really good.,2013-12-29,fMeEsfK9mynaSrO3eRqB7w

u6biYZCSOwyQ-WmXqQbbQA,Don't waste your money here. Food is average at best. Waited 45 minutes for a sandwich(po boy). Service lacked personality and our server was a stranger to our table. 30 minutes into our wait- we had a reassuring gesture that our food was nearly ready- false hope. Did they offer anything to snack on- no. Great ambience. But I can get that a hundred places in town.,2015-05-10,cR0isiayrFuA4pvcp2Fb-g

Why would I put hours of work into a cheap fabric to make a keepsake gift? I will miss you, JoAnn's!,2016-06-25,onp-MxljEkXqnkQvFJSW4g

Salsa was nice and he provided me some house hot sauce to raise the heat a bit.  I tried the Tomatillo sauce at Josh's suggestion and that was tasty and had a nice kick to it.  Their guacamole is good as well.  Dinner is yet to come but I expect will be good.,2016-01-07,NJiIL1fA-QofV43VVzSvQg
