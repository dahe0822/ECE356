hSKL-eAU_9rEyA3qmm8l-Q,My first time at this place and considering it was a thai restaurant, I ordered a beef pad thai. Before I approached the restaurant, I was reading other yelp reviews and came across a few negative reviews, claiming that the pad thai tasted like watered down ketchup. However, I ordered it anyways because I was feeling optimistic. When the dish arrived, it was red, I thought this was very odd considering most pad thai that I've seen is brown. I gave it a try and I was really disappointed.,2016-07-01,WeuCGlMHDA8EKB6Uo2O-vw,

Ra5fI9BEAuWWaLJSfkiCiQ,Ambiance was nice after I moved to a table far far away from the loud ass party last night. my filet was decent but surely not worth the 31.99 price tag. The vegetable appetizer could have been more substantial. The bread was great but I wasn't impressed with the entree or deserts. Glad we had groupon coupons to take some of the cost away.

ATeOjZzE3VOI-RW7FUFJpQ,Saturday and Sunday Brunch is wonderful! There are many delicious items to choose from. The brunch tacos are great and the Cobb Salad is my favorite.

fPX6XsfCPWnJwCyxsBVnxw,While the burgers are spectacular, I find this place maddening!! I live just miles from here and can never find it not crazy crowded. There is almost no seating -approx. 8 small tables (mostly 2 seaters) and maybe 8 seats at the bar. Yes, it's crowded because of great food, but they're losing so many customers for poor accommodation.  It's on the bottom of our ""go to"" list for this reason....,2013-12-31,UaQtsDLiDbwoAWT_dyza2A,

_ls-4oTpPixPOfxrwizrEA,Got take-out from here. The sandwich we ordered was average, I could have made one like it myself-- nothing special. The Hot Peppers (appetizer) was bland. Looks great decor-wise, but food is sub-par. Not sure if we'll try it again.,2013-04-19,UaQtsDLiDbwoAWT_dyza2A,
n-Muw3wnU-INyXkgPtZVVg,The food was so-so. The complimentary cornbread was the best part. The Tomato Basil Bisque was too thick and only tasted of basil.

PAfgC5DWkOpNn8E__mSJyw,The decor was to die for, just gorgeous! I was really excited to be in such a beautiful salon that hopefully wasn't going to break the bank:) however, when the girl took me back she led me to this warehouse type room that had none of the appeal of the rest of the salon. I was confused why that was even there when it just didn't match up. But anyways. The cut was good my stylist was nice.,2014-08-01,OuBz16Pd6WAv5mw8QPeY8Q,
rPL1gw_0Afm8nOAfLW53MQ,We decided to check this place out for the first time. And we picked a great time! Half price pizza on Thursdays!  The service was excellent. Not only did our server refill our drinks without even asking. But the manager of the restaurant also stopped by a couple times to see if we were enjoying ourselves. Great to see people who care about the customer experience. The pizza itself was pretty good. The bill would have came to over 40$ but with 1\/2 half off we only paid 25$  I would come back.,2014-08-01,OuBz16Pd6WAv5mw8QPeY8Q,

You absolutely MUST tell them when you order or you'll bring the wrath of the owners wife down on your head when you check out.   I think they give you smaller portions with the coupon deals!

He had two tails, 5 scallops, corn on cob, green beans and baked potato.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  This food was every bit as good as high end restaurants with $75 tails.  The server, he was excellent also.   I am a food snob , and very particular,so this is a big compliment to Red Lobter!,2017-05-03,MJjYdF7a0eufaqr5_hNnew,

Ribs are to be slow cooked so the meat falls off. I couldn't even use a fork to pry the little bit of meat off the rib. Go to Bugaboo Creek for good ribs. This place is awful.

LhbnPmr6aZG9xGZJ3dCiug,Dales is good but not that good. I've had just about everything on the menu and I have to say the fish dinners are the best. Some of the seasonings they use don't blend well with some dishes and the last time I ordered corn beef the bread  was soggy due to the foil they place inside of the container to keep it warm. Taco salads are huge enough for two and good. All in all not great but not bad either.,2016-05-20,7EvMWs0t_AlUh8j0_AjXvg,
