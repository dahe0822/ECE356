2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw,This little Mom and Pop place is the perfect place to relax. The artwork on the walls is nostalgic, as is the outstanding Thrifty ice cream and the candies which are a throwback to the good ol' days.  The burgers and hot dogs are outstanding.  Great place to take the family.  Prices and great for the quality of food produced.  Randy Walters, the owner, makes sure everyone's food is perfect and that they have a great time.  Go to TripAdvisor and write a review for this place.,2015-04-05,XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw
2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw,The menu is filled with a large variety of creatively dressed and served hamburgers and hot dogs, cooked to order.  Burgers are hand-formed and spiced, made of Nebraska corn fed, Angus chuck. DELICIOUS. Ice cream, sundaes, shakes & malted milks are available for dessert.  The restaurant has a nostalgic theme from the fifties.  Randy Walters, the owner and host welcomes every guest and makes them feel like long-time friends.  He makes up 50% of the great, relaxing atmosphere of Wimpy's Paradise.,2015-09-04,XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw
2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw,Congratulations to Randy Walters, owner and host of Wimpy's Paradise and Pittsburgh Willy's.  His Pittsburgher hot dog was ranked #21 by the New Times for the TOP 100 Entrees in the metro Phoenix area.  The Pittsburgher is a hot dog, topped with chipped ham which has been sauteed in butter, sprinkled with a bit of cheese.  This entree came in well ahead of Ted's Hot Dogs in Tempe, which made it in the top five hot dog places in the New Times' Best of Phoenix Readers' Choice 2015 nominations.,2015-09-05,XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw
2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw,Phoenix Magazine honored Randy Walters' Wimpy's Paradise today for their challenge burger.  I learned just this morning that Wimpy's Paradise had been named as one of the top five restaurants in Chandler earlier this year.,2015-09-15,XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw
2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw,The food is excellent, whether it be hot dogs, burgers, sandwiches or ice cream.  Randy Walters, owner and host, interacts with every customer to ensure their meal or snack is what they had expected.  His personality makes the little restaurant into more of a social gathering place.,2015-09-16,XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw
2T66oHiIi1Ql-j5IhwbGjw,Randy's food is prepared and tastes exactly as it is supposed to every time I have eaten here.  That is BECAUSE he has trained his chefs well.  His entire staff is extremely conscientious, with at least one person checking with every guest to ensure that his or her meal was prepared exactly as it was ordered.   Randy's personality and the nostalgic decor of his restaurant makes coming here a real treat.,2015-09-21,XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw
jAl7qblSDlPoQYp5L3f3Ow,I discovered Pittsburgh Willy's when it was located inside the antique shop on Az. Ave.  My mom and I were browsing around when we caught a heavenly scent coming from a corner of that store.  We followed our noses and made two great discoveries:  1) they make the very best hot dogs on Earth, and 2) Randy Walters, the owner and host, is a very friendly gentleman from Pittsburgh.  He greets each guest like a long-time friend, and he visits with everyone to make sure their meal is a great one.,2015-09-05,XiYZNW2B9xkIRsSuPbjYSw
jAl7qblSDlPoQYp5L3f3Ow,Best, friendliest restaurant staff to be found in the entire southwest U.S.  Quality of food is consistently excellent --well trained chefs get it right every time.

C6vH0qzmcerMkiJy3VO9qA,Came for Winterlicious. Had tiger prawn saganki, lamb shank and baklava. Get free cheese saganki with check in and watch cheese being set on FIRE! Prawns: fresh and paired well with a tomato-based sauce but it was not lit on fire table-side as its name suggested. Lamb shank: flavourful with both tender and dry parts. Baklava: good honey flavour but the texture was off. The pistachio filling was gritty and the phyllo layers were not well separated. Overall: food not special but well-prepared.,2016-02-08,zCQ8b-mkgo-qBIG9W-3DgA

They took a PRE BLENDED LIQUID out of the fridge and blended it with ice again. was pretty taken back (as you can imagine). asked for a new one, was confronted with quite a bit of attitude and waited awhile for them to make a new one. PS they didn't empty out the cup we returned. Instead they took it to the back room and put it into a fridge..... buyers beware.....,2014-05-24,zlXn42SjQsvSaej6gyMZag

VDaeKdcoME8Aiw9BEB7llg,This game is the only gambling I'm willing to do. The satisfying jingle of quarters, the comraderie of a table full of strangers united by the galloping of plastic horses, the atmosphere of frustration mixed with excitement. This table makes Vegas feel like family, and nothing can quite top the nostalgic thrill it brings. Even though the ponies didn't treat me well today, I'll be back next time I'm in town.

E4JyAzB5_2quptwtemyhYA,BRING CASH!  The business thinks they are saving you money by not charging a fee to run credit (so they don't have to absorb the cost), but they are really killing their customer base in bank fees. Yes, the ATM is free on their end, but depending on which bank you use, you could be charged up to $3.50 for the convenience. The menu explains that they want to save $50K\/year on credit card charges, but as a long-time customer, I wouldn't complain about a 25¢ fee to use my card while paying.,2017-11-02,Dkn4wGmErFolJHj9em8FTg

No smiles, no eye contact, wiped down our table with a dirty overly wet rag and just sloshed it around the top of the table then put the menus on top of the now soaking wet sticky table. When we asked her to see her rag to wipe up the table she got visibly irritated. We had to ring out the rag 2x's to get all of the wetness out, it was still not dry enough to absorb the sloppymess. Barmaid also had a very poor attitude.,2014-09-06,iegRLZO97Ug-P2XfV4zhZQ

mJBeo-CC0VG6ebDniGfgqw,I had my Jeep washed here twice, the first time they did their detailing job which was overpriced at 89.00, the treatments they put on the exterior washed off in the rain two days later leaving streaks all over the place. This last time I made the mistake of leaving a set of Bose earphones worth $145.00 on the console and an audio cable worth $10.00 on the dashboard, and the attendant doing the cleaning obviously figured they needed them more than I did. In short don't trust this operation.,2014-04-19,IFE0AcpzsErRUY3eA7lyZg

t8YhDctOEB2WsG88z12DIw,Good food, poor service. Hostess seated us at a dirty table. Our waitress didn't notice it was dirty when she took our drink order more than 15 minutes later. When we asked her to wipe off the table, she looked surprised. When she did get around to it, she left behind a used toothpick and a rumpled sugar packet. We had to flag her down when our empty beer glasses failed to get her attention. Then we never saw her again.

odFtT5pqWeG-moGjvcNazw,My experience hasn't been anything like the reviews -- apartment is cheap, a little shabby, but commensurate with price. No bed bug problem to speak of. My biggest beef is that the free Wi-Fi is atrocious -- slow and sporadic. If you rely on Internet access, you might think about factoring in the cost of Cox (which I believe is available to individual units). There's a lot of renovation going on, hopefully they fix this problem along with the other spiffing up.,2017-07-23,bSnLSfsQoSOBBBEJB1WQiw

zI15YREq7bHnLSybgM4Itw,NEVER have a wedding or a special event here. From the beginning it was a joke we should have backed out before we began. They only care about getting their money and more money. Employees that I paid good money for should not be eating my food that I paid $3800 for as well as when asked to save my top cake (tradition) to then throw it away. As well as the food (health code says 2 hours) our dinner was 1 hour. How is a bride and bridesmaid cutting a cake while employees eat.,2015-10-29,F5l3CnksBNxujcZx6umCBw

My wedding was a great and beautiful one because how hard is it to put table clothes down..we did the centerpieces cuz I didnt want to get charged for them doing it. It was amazing night cuz of the people we had there so I had a fun night but after paying 11,000 with the rooms we had saved and our wedding you think our room would be included. This place is a joke. If your planning an event DONT DO IT HERE.,2015-10-29,F5l3CnksBNxujcZx6umCBw

The floors are dirty, they leave the cold prepared salads out on the counter, and the fried food section just needs to be shut down. My dog would have a hard time trying to eat the dried out crap they try to sell.  No that's ok. Won't treat me like I don't deserve better. I'm going to the one on Sahara and Durango.

I heard every line while sitting there- they told me months ago I needed new struts- took it into dealership and there was no issue.  This time brake pads- for just front brake pads at $350.

5c5UirXrN1UsEZiM6FGP9g,First time at ArtBurger and not impressed. I came with a friend because we found a  deal through groupon. We had the gourmet for 2 people for 25$! First off SERVICE was slow! The burger was mediocre. I would have rather gone too burger deville.the lack of attention was appealing the male waiter should be fired. He gave me so much attitude. I had asked for caramelized onions thinking they were the same thing as grilled onions.Clearly they were not. The way he responded to me was so rude.,2015-11-22,jqommpsTWWDkxwo-vgKyFQ

We chose to go to Chez Delmo as a Canadian friend(good friend) had mentioned it to us.

CUCXgBntRrZP4DGRgPtBuA,Unreliable and disappointing! I hired the owner for interior design. She charged a hefty ""consultation fee"" and took several weeks before emailing me a dozen recommendations. I didn't mind, but when it took me the same amount of time to review her many emails, she abruptly informed me she had moved on from my project and assumed I wasn't interested.  She said she would try to circle back and I never heard from her again.  I tried emailing her to remind her of our agreement and again...crickets.,2016-08-01,eQ0BeXcg-XTUP1zsojZT6w

QRJuF1Abui7KsH6G5ozD6g,We were excited to find out that there was a Mongolian BBQ restaurant near us. Unfortunately, we were disappointed that many of the meats were pre-seasoned and pre-cooked. The initial bowls used for filling were small compared to the displayed bowl portions. In the end, the remaining volume was filled by a required starch. The produce choices were interesting and varied. However, when asking about the ingredients of the sauces, we were given very little information.,2013-12-14,WH9gyX9Sd4J2NCoyaU7Phw

XMf_pBT_YvlvOgfxGEdGoA,Best hair salon in Brampton that I tried. Had my hair done by Marco; very nice guy and made me laugh. He fixed my hair that was done by a girl that seemed to be just learning and was taking orders from the owner ( this hair salon was Highlight Essence, also in Brampton) which I found very sketchy, she totally messed up my roots, they were a 2 tone blonde and not one colour (which it should be). Needless to say I wasn't impressed but Marco did a nice job and didnt over charge me! BEST PLACE 4hair,2014-08-21,eZvm-BhX-Qt88hG33G664w

qphDNTJlIpmh67A3N1IFDQ,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SCAM ARTIST. She does not have a business license ( you can call the local licensing) she does not have a breeders license ( you can call LV animal control, use the name Kristen Lea Dawson) and she has not registered an AKC puppy since 2012 ( you can call AKC as well). Please do not give this fraud your hard earned money, we learned the hard way.,2014-01-20,hyQgJD6FxXwQlrilUF80Ag
qphDNTJlIpmh67A3N1IFDQ,Before people start throwing around stupid comments like ""the PEOPLE writing THESE reviews are as sad as the lady running the scam"" (notice the use of correct English), they need to look at what their doing first. Why are they on this page to begin with? Answer: because they are looking up breeders to buy from. So a tip for the future: use your brain (or at least what is left of it) and think before you review on things that have nothing to do with you.,2014-11-15,8sXHlrHH4IAwQ-mOcOTdLg

ZfPcpbZssIMrYBSg9jXNdw,i would not recommend this place just because of their 50% price increases.  especially on pizza.  i usually get a ten inch meat lovers for lunch each week for $10. now it costs $15. they have raised their prices to make up for the over budget on their new renovations inside.  that is ridiculous.  i'm not going back.  the food was great but overly over priced now.  ill go back to spinato's across the street.,2013-10-08,cDVxcagmxXnuWvk3j8IiUA

We asked to be seated elsewhere.  We were told that the tables were all reserved.  Flat out lied!!!!  When asked a second time she said it again!!!!  Food was overpriced for what u got.  Won't be going there again.  Would try them again but not after the lying and snippy attitude of the young gal who sat us.,2017-01-29,WYFTqGGJ3mMwxLtRhddCpg

MS-hfug4QDXqb_Mws3qlzA,Stumbled into this place while looking for food in Parkdale late in the evening. A tiny taqueria with a lot of character and really great food. We tried their tacos, quesadillas, and the Persian cucumber salad. Everything was great and so well priced and the Persian Cucumber salad really stood out. We also tried their own brews and it was very light and refreshing. Also, watch out for their $4shots of the day.,2017-08-30,d4R7bh6TJlIwP0BJ87SkdA

YBNmWKk0c_yMGGv24gCrXQ,We came for breakfast for Father's Day.  It took over 45 minutes to get our food.  Several items were wrong and had to be returned, which took an additional 10 minutes.  Most of our party had their food and completed it before some of the members of our party even got their breskfsst.  The food was OK but not great.  Obvious, the sevice was bad.  Would not recommend this restaurant.,2013-06-16,dmsz__xB7hIh2KPhUfSPBw
YBNmWKk0c_yMGGv24gCrXQ,This place was good the first time I went like 6 months ago I went there today and it was a disaster. I ordered a BLT my bacon was a stale and looked green my fries were not hot at all it was like my food had been sitting around for 20 min. My friend got breakfast the sausage tasted like plastic the bread was crumbly and the eggs looked like the processed eggs from McDonalds. I am not one to complain at all but after eating a part of the BLT my stomach is killing me. They need a new chef,2013-08-10,KnorPiYBjeCDDz4-7aCI_g

gFsiHkTKeQ3Vt0o3Bs7oXw,This place is more-so for people who likes their cheese so thick, it slides right off the pizza, leaving you with a naked slice of bread & sauce... Pizza wasn't horrible but the buffalo chicken salad was. The chicken looked as if it was chewed on and spit out, with saliva juices full of buffalo sauce. The salad really did looked ""tossed"" and amateur... There's a billion other pizza places to try out here, so I definitely won't be stuck with ""basic"".

JJi7c7uiTzCqeWNTsldgXQ,I heard good things about this place. When I tried it today, I had very high hopes. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and the steamed pork dumplings. The General Tso's was alright. Mediocre really. It was clear the chicken was hand cut, and not swimming in the chemical taste you get from other places, so I appreciated that. The dumplings, however, were not good. Whatever dough they use, they use way too much of it and it overpowers the pork inside. I wouldn't order it again.,2016-06-19,NYfZoMPn7guKYlnO_F8gUg

e9UsRb-fmza5ukU8Ftduew,Not as I expected Dinner buffet for $21.99?  Totally not worth it.  sushi are pre-made. Oysters been sitting on the tray for a long time, feel warm! Salad and fruit bar: pineapple from the can, and the backyard oranges.  soup choice are very basic and for low class of buffet.  the clams also full of sands. this restaurant 1-2 stars the most. I would recommend go to Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet, same buffet style, food are better, taste better, fresh sushi, and lower price ($15.99) 4 stars at least.,2013-07-03,ejlB4FTP5Ir2VW4dT4_m7w

e9UsRb-fmza5ukU8Ftduew,Try the walnut shrimp. There was an extremely rude waitress there and she had glasses and a pony tail- I will not be returning again because she made a comment about how I never tip and she actually had the odasity to demand that I tip for the bussers. In my opinion this is a eater pricey buffet- 22 dollars per person for dinner and 2.50 for a soft drink.

I ordered the buffalo chicken salad again a few days ago, still huge  but HOLY HELL it was HOT. WOW. I had to stop midway through and drink a glass of milk and eat a piece of bread. Next time I order I'm going to request to go a tad light on the buffalo sauce. Still a killer salad though! They don't skimp on the toppings or the meat.,2015-12-28,7wBcX6Xt6Tb3h0rcfyym6g

I went asking for a vch, and left with a Christina. I had to go to adrenaline in order to be re pierced properly. When I called to complain, the manager was extremely ignorant, stating that 514ink and Adrenaline were apples and oranges. I explained that vch and Christina's were apples and oranges and it was unfortunate her piercer did not know where a clitoris was.,2015-08-05,gETOoEgP5zTuGUSazb_jDA

X4VET17jRHWs_XlNIuIlKg,I have to agree with the other post about this guy. My boyfriend hired this guy for a romantic meal for my birthday. We spent the entire meal talking about the big-ego'd chef who just bragged about how busy he was the entire time and how he wanted to quit and move to Vegas. The food was bland and not impressive. He cleaned which was nice. He was very rushed, and an hour and 15 mins late. Not an enjoyable experience and I don't even want to know what my boyfriend paid for this letdown of a gift.,2014-02-07,p0bMdKGjZIKtct7rLQD-dQ

D2nfOrnJ2OBlX_428sKyMg,I had tried the Japanese pan fried  noddles and the Thai curry soup. The soup was tasty but the noodles in the Thai curry were undercooked. They were hard and chewy instead of soft and tender. Japanese noodles with tofu were overcooked and dry. The tofu tasted like it was cooked a long time ago. It needs to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Stick with the mac and cheese or pad thai for safe bets.,2014-05-26,IfrGYaL-5ekfLcM7xCvKSg

sT9oX8vDwD9btDakUM2H5w,What a disappointment since the original owners sold this place. This started off as a unique pizzeria with a bit of a New York feel to the flavours and unique za options. Owners sold and, as is often the case in this city, new owners know nothing about making fresh and rich pizza. Now it's not as clean, the pizza is dry, not enough sauce, what little there is is dried up by the time you get a pie home. Seriously sell to someone who knows how to make pizza please!,2017-02-27,eqPSfFRztr3fQ5roQVia1w

My husband and I noticed how busy it always was and decided to try it out...the chicken on the rocks and shawarma sandwiches are amazing...kind of a couple times a month craving.  I'm not one for spice so I don't usually get any spice (I have young kids too) but the one time I got ""mild"", my eyes watered tremendously.  Love the garlic sauce.,2016-08-06,uybfvd9ynmWYLcgktrJ4dQ

Gnak5GIP56-gewcs_mbqtg,This was one of the WORST restaurants I've ever been too. Not only were the servers very rude and snobby but it was very unorganized seeing as they don't use computers to keep track of the orders. A few of us ordered the steaks medium rare\/medium well and they came raw and virtually with a heartbeat. And when we sent them back they did not apologize for the inconvenience. When the bill came, because it was a larger party there was so much confusion it was a mess. I would never go back.,2017-10-14,RkxPJtp6zcakWJ0zPZqAfQ

p0KS7XuSlaMToh_h_I6QIA,This church seems to be truly spirit led. I've been challenged intellectually and spiritually, feel that they really ""get"" how a church should study, worship and affect communities. That being said, every time I've attended, I've been truly disappointed that all the people I encounter are too busy with each other to notice anyone else. I've always been put off by greeters, it feels fake and forced, but to not make any kind of connection with any of the people one encounters, is disappointing.,2015-05-03,RkVwXLIWb7cRq1FIV9yUuw

zVW3XeWuqg-MkSFxRKROOg,Nandos is a popular chicken chain in the United Kingdom. The first time that I'd tried it (after hearing raving reviews from other Americans), I wasn't very impressed. But then I gave it more chances and caught on- their sauces are ADDICTINGG. Comes in ranges of spiciness and once you start, ya can't stop. Their Peri-Salted Chips is good too (compared to their regular chips) because it's full of MSG goodness which is nicely rare, as everything in the UK tends to be a bit more bland than the US.,2016-09-28,l6Oup8BhYBOI4bGrnqrGbQ

vnvQ0lD9MDje2DFde9PKQA,Likes: Room was beautiful and very spacious.4 people and in our suite we could have easily fit 10 people comfortably (using the pull out beds). There was a big kitchen in the main common area and a microwave, frig, and toaster. Queen size bed in the second room and King in the master. plus was the view  and the huge shades that covered when you wanted to close and to open. There was also a projector tin the main area.

raVyoZbWWuN7JcFUdT7k2g,I really like the laid back kind of dark atmosphere. Not a place for kids! Which is great! The beef in the House dynamite was very chewy and tough. Not a good cut of meat at all. The portions are pricy but very small. Daily specials but they can not be combined with groupons. So groupon-ers expect to pay full price for everything! Strong drinks! Was not a fan of the Pinku No Hana saketini, it taste like fresh flowers smell, but not in a food way. More like perfume-y. Not impressed overall. Sorry,2013-09-03,7maNDeX3j3oQSRDaqxXp1w

pFQaji0idkrzv5J-qTQ82Q,Worst food ever. I hardly ever complain but but this was sooo bad that I walked in hungry and walked out sick. I have never ever had such a bad experience.  The service was slow. The facility was a mess. The soda fountain was broken.  Every thing I tried was to hard to stomach.  My brother in law spent about $41 but honestly that is way to much to pay for food that taste like it came from a sewage treatment plant.,2014-02-03,38P4f4gKjaUlGFBPOxcOeQ

PJ64Zdo0h2mQMmX7cpNJBA,Took my wife with me to try this place that was highly recommended by a good friend. My friends recommendation was correct. Its an older building with minimum exterior beautification. The interior would remind you of a good old mom & pop restaurant. The staff are really friendly and appear to enjoy working at Letty's. My tip: Give this place a try.,2013-07-19,6t8Sci67bLRY1d8Lk6EKWA

OETh78qcgDltvHULowwhJg,The food is incredible and service is awesome. Be sure to ask for Michelle in the cocktail lounge and Anthony in the restaurant for Exceptional service.

OETh78qcgDltvHULowwhJg,Fun atmosphere.  I'd carefully go back. My wife had the Kobe filet, very good.  I had a bone in New York that was ""ok"".  What was NOT ""ok"" was the sommelier.  He decanted a $180 bottle of wine suspiciously while I was not present.  WHAT? Highly unusual!!  Without going into a full wine review, I was a little less than satisfied with the choice he made.  Our waitress saved the evening with a replacement while the sommelier stomped around.  Be warned about your wine purchase and experience here.,2013-06-26,mJ_2TxFfMj1VNvHQFhKghQ

FRFHeIau2YmIoSY6ytOlFg,I'm a current server here and this place initially blew me away! I love the concept of not just bar food. Instead of the usual chicken fingers or mozzarella sticks you can find at any local saloon this place has the best meat you can find! Come in and fall inlove with our 100% grass fed wagyu beef!,2012-08-18,jyXBSgo4OILHR-TTET-LCg
0IYsvn19i1xY9kw-TrD2sw,ou can actually have a conversation with this guy. He's got the experience and doesn't just make you feel like a random customer walking in. Respectable.

uFL4KroMu-dFRsSJrcFzVQ,The food was good, but our waitress wasn't the friendliest and seemed like she didn't like her job very much or maybe had a problem serving us. We sat outside in the patio area which was nice. However, when I asked our waitress for the check, she disappeared and was nowhere to be found. After waiting for about 15 minutes, I went to the bar and asked them if they could get her which they did not and I just paid my bill to the bartender, which was odd. Again, good food, bad service!,2016-06-28,l3c-f6aycZj27BmAQi6B6g

AySYiLZOXgZfkPWwCCitNg,This is a horrible place! Even after I told the tax preparer he was missing money from my tax return he still sent it out and a week later called and said he missed something and sent in for the money I had already told him about it took months to get my return and he never returned my calls! Horrible service,2013-06-21,5yPQOXe6Gj5-8aNzLGQvdg
AySYiLZOXgZfkPWwCCitNg,He also said it would be $75 and  after doing my taxes raised the price tremendously!  Even after not doing them right the first time... And now he's texting me and threatening to take back my tax money this guy is crazy! Not someone I would recommend or go to again.,2013-06-21,5yPQOXe6Gj5-8aNzLGQvdg
AySYiLZOXgZfkPWwCCitNg,Oh so u decided to write me back on this rather then give me a call like a real business person???? Hahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahhahah horrible horrible business!,2013-06-21,5yPQOXe6Gj5-8aNzLGQvdg
AySYiLZOXgZfkPWwCCitNg,horrible first of all Ramsay Tandal told me he would charge me $75 since I know him personally then before he sent in my taxes he quoted me lower then what another tax place didI told him that it was a lower amount he told me that they must not know what they are doing and that he was right he proceeded to turn my taxes into the IRS and when I would ask him for my tax info he wouldn't give them to me and then finally said he messed up and had to send in for the extra money I previously told,2013-06-23,5yPQOXe6Gj5-8aNzLGQvdg
AySYiLZOXgZfkPWwCCitNg,to me and then finally said he messed up and had to send in for the extra money I previously told him he was missing in the first place and told me it would be more money after he told me a price already and I didn't even get my second return for months. I tried calling him and he never answered my calls if he would do this to somebody he personally knows  He has always done my taxes for free but now he's charging me $125 and doesn't help me with his child or pays his child support,2013-06-23,5yPQOXe6Gj5-8aNzLGQvdg
AySYiLZOXgZfkPWwCCitNg,I asked Ramsay to give me half of daycare which was $60 a month he would give me money and cancel the checks so how am I suppose to pay him $125 when he takes money away from his daughter? He claims I keep her away but every time I ask him to pick her up he never can! Bs!!!,2013-06-23,5yPQOXe6Gj5-8aNzLGQvdg
AySYiLZOXgZfkPWwCCitNg,What's even more funny is now that I'm putting up the truth Ramsay is threatening me with putting his own baby mom thru bankruptcy lmao he's a joke and so is this business!,2013-06-23,5yPQOXe6Gj5-8aNzLGQvdg

fWetLvfQXqpZcBQLHldUhA,The elevators suck. The 2 days I been here I had to walk down the stairs to get my food. The workers don't seem to care about your problem.

bLi48v8Div6Qm2Fyaw0C6Q,The two for Tuesday was a great deal. The gnocchi were tender and oh so favorful. The Pork Osso buco was awesome. Plus a bottle of wine was great. I would highly recommend Hodges and look forward to going back.,2013-12-10,GXKPG5l-TnEk-SXB10_gFw

8zN3nV0zbtE377_XhlvabA,It's important to understand the drink pricing. There are actually 3 price tiers. They have ""happy day"" drink specials, meaning those special prices are from 6am-6pm. After 6pm, the prices return to the ""normal"" prices. However, on Friday & Saturday nights, they don't charge a ""cover"" at the door, but drink prices go up at 9pm when the band starts playing. They don't warn you of this in advance, so be advised. It caught me by surprise to see the band surcharge & I didn't appreciate the tactic.,2017-05-27,164kjF6go0PB2Y06fikHUw

sNpLtuBXVwCBHH5qx3Byrg,The food here is acceptable - as expected at an airport (though the cheese curds are surprisingly good).  However, the service here is HORRIFIC.  The waitress, after about 10 min swung by and dropped the menu in front of me without a word or a glance.  She then failed to return for another 15-20 min - who knows, it could have even been longer, but my husband and I moved to the bar as we were tired of waiting.  The bartender took several minutes to address us as well but was at least friendly.,2013-05-05,rB7wMi0Z0JFaX7OvD5-KNA

qHQPvp6pZ75fB63kOKUPqg, used Rick from the Carpet Monkey to come to our house to clean an L shape sofa and an area rug. He was awesome and very professional.  He arrived on time and get to work right away. He was fast but also very good cleaner. He even asked us to check his work, making sure we are satisfied before he continued to clean the area rug. We have a dog that shed and Rick removed 80%  to 90% of the dog hair on the sofa. We will definitely use them again in the future.,2014-04-14,Btv9d2_o34u2akMMeXWYxg

ByR685ThcDqQ_bb4A1oj_Q,I'm so impressed with the food! I went there for dinner. Relax environment and very friendly service. Their corn soup is very tasty! And the bread tastes so great that I still remember the taste the next day!! The bison burger is amazing! Definitely a hidden gem in Leslieville!

The manager was more concerned with berating us about coming back then finding out what happened. The nail techs were more focused on making fun of customers then doing their jobs. Received the refund for hers but we will not be back, will go to Dream Nails instead.,2013-08-29,c4OmXa8Wl4Ab-VUxTJy_2Q

qKoCB0pmB0wwdDHpw19bjA,The girl who started my pedicure was so rough with the cuticle pusher she cut open the edge of my nail. It wouldn't stop bleeding and I obviously told her not to continue the pedicure. She and the guy who works there kept insisting they could just put polish on my toes, but aside from not wanting to get nail polish into an open cut, I thought it would be pretty unhygienic to get my blood into a polish that would likely be used on many other people. Definitely never coming back!,2013-03-03,P6JVTNhUyBPps-NE5wnWxw

mES9E5K4HbYoPFXGv0pUuw,Uhm, I had the chicken tacos and really didn't like them. They were soft, grilled tortillas - more like a quesadilla. Way too much cheese, and no sour cream.

DYnFGGYU3SkrKT_G4djpYQ,On Sunday i went over to Coach which is right behind it and parked in their adjoining parking lot. My friend went over and got tacos and a burrito to go. 2 and a half hours later we go to get into our car and leave and our car was gone. The taco nazis had our car towed.The tacos aren't worth it.,2013-01-24,ne-B6p1WdaHKvl9BapD3yQ
3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA,Our server Robin was hilarious. Not only was she efficient she made our whole experience great. The wait was suppose to be 30 min but we were seated before that. We had wings as an appetizer after they had let us sample some sauce flavors  and we love gold metal sauce. Delicious! Burgers were cooked to perfection. Robin even bought our dessert. Pot brownie is highly recommended. We will most definitely be back.,2013-07-13,XKBas3xMKC3QV9hU4hrumA

I saw him treat a table of older gentlemen who had sat at a table that needed to be bussed like crap yelling at them and waving his hands in the air rolling his eyes.  Horrible treatment to people who choose to dine in your establishment.  Guys gotta go.  Did it in front of a packed patio.  Not the way to honor your customers.  Patience and appreciation goes a long way.  He misrepresents your establishment.,2016-04-08,Qu8a6nCM_0-TJejCSsh2xA

h3ju3Juh42v3JkL4bSXrAg,Honestly not quite sure about these other reviews but this was the worst experience I had at a nail salon. My gel manicure took all of 10 minutes, and I don't mean that in a good way. She cut my nails to the nub, didn't bother to file them, did nothing to my cuticles, and slapped the polish in as fast as she could. Other quality gel manicures I have received took time and were of high quality. The paint doesn't even go to the edge of my nail. Never again.,2016-04-15,FyY0XY9qvb-qdcY9KNWvBA

Compared to my usual La Belle Nail Spa, this place is loud, cluttered, 14 employees sitting around waiting for walk-ins while playing on their phones and eating and drinking at their stations.

kPfhSK0kcUmOTmC5DEjaDw,the food here is ok, but the service is horrible. we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and gave them a few chances and each time the service is worst then the last. The last straw was when they acted confused and didnt know where to sit us. It shouldnt have been difficult as we had a party of five. Then we sat and sat and sat for at least 15 minutes with no service. Not even to ask for our drinks. I was so frustrated, we just got up and left.

RLUlL9s_FOIhoTOvb7LS7A,I've been coming here for nearly 3 years. They are efficient here BUT only deal with Casey. This guy is their best employee. If he is not quarterbacking your service then leave. He's awesome and will look out for you.  Other mechanics there will attempt to up sell you. It's their job, but don't trust them, only let Casey inspect their work and recommendations. He is trust worthy.

-g98HHGe2FH-oOCQAasBzw,My really wanted to like this shop. Jenny the manager did my nails.   She was fast and did a great job with the fill.   But then she left for 20 min before I got polish applied.  Another tech was supposed to finish, but she had another client at her table.   When Jenny returned 20 min later she finished my nails but by this time I was so annoyed after having to sit with no explanation. The polish turned out so-so the nail art was terrible.

3rJWdxGB9QCzVOu5PWgeOg,Went to purchase a grill at the store. Said $99 online, called and verified they had the product in the morning. Got there to see the grill was $199. The guy at the store told me he could not sell it to me for that price even though the model, item number, and store were the same. He said if I bought it online that I would have to wait to pick it up at store until next day. I'll take my business elsewhere.,2014-03-01,0ajz_362dD5U8JXEIX_oOQ

JN8s_dgw9nrSzkHnXxNOtg,Ok, no one mentioned how TINY this place is! I think there are only 6 or 7 chairs in the place. So my recommendation is take-out. But the food is truly amazing. I had the brisket (tender and succulent), the greens, pinto beans and sweet potato fries (so yummy). And the bourbon pecan pie was to die for. Also: an amazing bar menu.

I get shellac manicures, waxing and pedicures and have been 100% pleased every time. My daughter gets gel nails and loves them. We go about every 3-4 weeks when the nail growth becomes noticeable, even though the actual manicures still look great. Calling ahead is a good idea.

mbD6Yu6c4SORd1pTeBePzg,Danny, the Manchild owner is corrupt. Actually opened an account just 2 review this shop. Spent approx 10K @Devious in couple years. Then was harassed & threatened by the owner after he demanded to charge additional for a quarter sized area that bubbled, cracked & peeled a few weeks. They prep'd & painted my entire vehicle. FAILED 2 follow instructions 4 custom paint. Returned 4+ times because they couldn't attach OEM wing properly, each failure nearly ripped completely off, causing more damage,2013-02-03,-kYa7kfJCvLtcLGzs7UxLg

GGEeGKUez_pGqYXtk-sKvQ,Went on a Sunday in the early afternoon and I really liked it. I got the classic eggs Benedict and it was awesome. Eggs perfectly poached and I got to sub a fruit cup for potatoes. The rest of my group, not as much. My son got a cheeseburger, but a side of French fries was an upsell. Hubby got a fish sandwich, which came with no tartar or cocktail sauce and the waitress was scarce. He ate it with ketchup.,2017-08-16,wiCXZ7hDUFCi-f5mo7dtJA

NAqA8cgPDp5cbOvArAo9vA,Ask for Gary M. They have gone above and beyond to make sure my new car is perfect. From fixing the recalls before I take the vehicle to changing 2 worn tires free of charge.

It feels like my grandma is back there cooking for everyone.  the place is beautiful similar to a peace full cabin. The owner is a great person to talk and is always accommodating for my pickiness.

g0rTFoLeIR9-xj9bOUWQDQ,This spot would get more customers just off these great reviews, except it's hard to receive traffic when the address on the Yelp page is completely wrong.

yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,We went for the lunch buffet, they had a different variety of indian food than I am used to which was great, but the food was mostly disappointing. We liked the naan, and the chicken tikka masala. Most shockingly they had no desserts besides fruit. Also ordered a mango lassi which was not very good, it was too sour and mostly tasted like runny yogurt.,2013-05-05,RcQuN9CwIHaD5Udu7IcmkQ

Steaks are tasteless and the creamed spinach tastes microwaved. And if you don't order dessert be prepared for the waiter to snatch the menu from your hands and insult you under his breath.

2zd-1R3CdnaMDXTAEVa2Qg,Horrible Food. No grilled chicken available, was offered rotisserie instead. They had 3 racks of chicken cooking, 2 racks were dark & burnt-looking yet they insisted it was very juicy. Bullshit. The top rack looked fresh, but he insisted on the darker ones As expected, it was very dry and horrible. Even rice was cold and flavourless, tasted lake they used old frozen veggies (with freezer-burn) in the rice. The feijoada had great flavour but found a 2"" strand of steel wool in it. Go elsewhere.,2013-11-28,-sIjpol1qIZVuBWIQicaeg

Nn2X-kVJuBjGogWT4CQhSQ,My sister in law and me were looking for a nail salon she called to ask what time they closed they said 7... it was 6:45 they were SO nice and asked how far we were that they would wait! Which was the first to say that out of the 5 previous ones we called. We were a little hesitant to go since we thought they would be in a rush for time. When we got there they were so nice and welcoming. They did a great job and we had our girl time. We have now found our new nail salon close to our new home :),2013-08-25,lk8FcuzEgigL3Fatp4Vw-g

zzwicjPC9g246MK2M1ZFBA,Bad. Its just bad. I've given this location 3 or 4 tries and I'm disappointed everytime. First the soups were wateted down. Now the soup is so thick its like I'm eating cheese sauce. The fresh broccoli is soggy. How am i to eat that? Everything looks as if it has been sitting since noon and has minimal flavor and low quality. For the same price I coukd have gone to sweet tomatoes and went home happy. I will never return to this location.  The only good thing was my cheese bread.,2013-09-25,yqICpTp6lgjuIifxa7t2Hw

O_Yi95nUeeqSudiMlUfttQ,Large menu options and quick service, however the food itself was lukewarm at best: some pieces of green pepper, corn, beef, etc. were cold. They do try to cycle as many people as they can, very pushy to get you out as fast as possible. Other than somewhat cold food and pushy wait staff, the food itself taste good.,2015-12-26,AKgWNRo2L0zEL0NCgJPJxQ
O_Yi95nUeeqSudiMlUfttQ,The service was bad. It's basically just ""self-serve."" Some of the servers were quite rude. They already added the tip to your payment.

I'd be OK if I didn't reorder the gyoza, octopus, orange beef tacos (like beef jerky), and scallops with coconut lobster (the lobster was breaded and deep fried, like coconut shrimp).

LtLpq75BaIVtKa5Z-H7T8w,Decorated beautifully. Ambiance is a 5. The chairs were extremely uncomfortable for a plus sized person. Ordered the French onion soup, it had 2 french fries in it. The waiter never came back to ask if we were enjoying our food. In fact, he didn't serve us - someone else did. We were asked if we wanted bread, we said yes but never received it. Bottom line, they're trying to be on the upscale side but offer very little menu choices and are overpriced for the quality and service.,2014-05-24,J4FT66pD2ZidFzeWC4noiw

LPWMKKcGeWmJgf8t_TIcYQ,Things you will need when you visit here: PATIENCE and an ABUNDANCE of TIME. The food is GREAT, but on average there's a total of ONE employee. That means your waitress or waiter is also the cook, and when this place gets busy--it's time for you to get ZEN...--for like a good 45 minutes.(Seriously.),2012-08-14,Bjdqqc-3M71z8Gbpt3lhYw

Our server seemed a bit new to the trade, and so was a bit over-conscientious about everything, (topping off our wine glasses frequently to keep them juuuuust under 1\/2 full) but that's a far better problem to have than the alternative. And it wasn't so much a problem as it was cute. The manager (owner?) was friendly, and the whole place had a sort of upscale-yet-welcoming atmosphere.,2013-04-05,auFnXYuXJmYXTQHP-jaXfw

RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g,Absolute letdown. Pricey, long wait, non-existent service, picked over food. Crab was snow ... cold, not split, broken (no claws) and overcooked. The shrimp\/crawfish also overcooked and mushy. Oysters tasted ""off"" ... very off which should have told me something. Hind sight is 20\/20 and I am on day three of sickness. Service was the worst. We got only one round of cokes, and the dishes stayed stacked in dirty piles on our table and every table in our section. Seriously avoid. Not worth the $$$$.,2017-09-18,NAElDz2QwKj0RP9hEO1kAQ

OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A,I got take-out. The food was not bad. It's not the best, but I can eat it again. I would not go and eat there because the place looks too cramped. What I didn't like was that almost all Indian restaurants let you choose rice or naan bread with your entree but here the dish came with rice and I had to order naan bread separate. This would've still been ok but when I got home there was no rice with my dishes!!! They charged me extra for the naan bread and then skipped on the rice!! Not impressed.,2014-04-13,7sd_-tTMHzgh3MWMGepm6w

5Rztf2RObLnq3h6HDmry2w,I've been going here from the end of 2015 all the way up to present day 2017 and from my experience, which expands both night and daytime classes to having class on all days of the week to a few days to going in the summer\/fall\/spring semesters that I can conclude that the vast majority of students here are those who are in their late 20s who are trying to turn their life around.

I'll assume he's the owner. He'll be watching. Even when you think it's safe and you can enjoy your meal. BAM - he'll appear and either shut off your grill, lecture you, and\/or refuse you more meat. If you miss him, don't worry, just look over our shoulder. He'll be right behind you. If he's not, check the plants. He'll be there for sure.,2017-01-20,IZOKc5S07wJxdgSKxMnNfA

MRXuq7bRQf_8k2ThB6HFdA,Stay away from this tour! Waste of money. Rent a car and save yourself the cash. This tour just drove us to Niagara on the Lake and Niagara Falls. It's like a hop on hop off. It's only an hour away from Toronto so you can drive yourself. It was a straight shot drive and no fees anyway so if there are 2-4 of you renting a car will save you money. Driver just talks on the mic and shared boring information. Just google and you'll get more interesting stuff. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TOUR.,2016-09-27,XF7IfpFOozCUW1Aay35UnQ

-V9N7rpVrqm56_QYidCovQ,Phosphates often come from dead and decayed organics in your pool. This can be from fertilizer in your own lawn, or it can be blown in from the wind (even invisible amounts). They also come... from an abundance of debris. When you often get leaves, pollen, flowers, bugs, or anything like that in the pool they will sit in your filter and break down into phosphates. Another common cause is dogs, and lots of people swimming in the pool. Keep phosphates away with Stay Fresh Pool Care service!,2013-11-21,PUwNp21PSfufmxKk2Jpg-A

2zcTawwmBNh9hpayAw2bQA,I've struggled to find a hair salon with the passion that hair stylist, Alina has for her work. Thorough, thoughtful, and professional; Alina gave me what I can honestly say is my best hair cut and dye job ever. She is meticulous and focused but still makes time for small talk with substance. I'm so happy with my golden blonde locks and can't wait for next time! I will go out of my way to recommend that if you're looking for great hair and a relaxing nice environment, try Alina at Vanguard!,2013-06-19,Qsd_q6ptI4ruy_9GALCtNA

q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,By far, the best sushi buffet I've ever had. Although they have many sushi buffets back in NY, none of them are comparable to Umiya. Excellent service and wide selection including desserts, yakitori, steaks, many appetizers, special sushi rolls, fresh sushi pieces. The soft she'll crab appetizer and baby octopus yakitori was my favorite. The sauce they had for my ribeye steak was delicious and went perfectly well with my steak. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! I'd come back to Vegas just to eat here again.,2013-08-27,FBd3k6cFH6Dadd_iJvotwA

FehqDxPRMCYE6BHOTCl9eg,The ""free"" oil changes they REQUIRE you to purchase when you buy a car are actually $75. On the paperwork it's called a ""maintenance agreement"" and you can cancel it w\/in 30 days & get your money back. If your vehicle has a factory warranty,you need to have it serviced at a dealership that sells the make of your car for repairs to be covered. Do not let anyone tell you different. I know mechanics who hate telling people their claim was refused even if they have receipts from other places.,2016-08-03,xt8JZ2n_aAN06tM_XxafZQ
