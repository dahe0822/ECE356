What caught my eye is that they have a dish named 'Goat Amritsari' and if an Indian restaurant has a goat dish you know it's legit. So when i placed the first order with them I pigged out and ordered sooo much that my bill was a $100 and mind you this was only for my wife and I! The food was excellent and Earth Indian has become one of my go-to restaurants! A must try is the Prawn Balchao!,2013-04-15,7iPbsw-VQ-opYs6fbVwWGQ,

AKMvsVr_9meoSmawkEBe4g,When I first walked in this restaurant, I specifically asked, VERY clearly if they took debit for payment and the waitress said yes.  I declined going into several restaurants in this strip mall because they did not have debit.  I proceeded to get nearly no service unless requested two or three times.  When I went to pay - no debit.    At a huge inconvenience (time and otherwise), I eventually found a bank machine.   Food was decent, everything else was sub-par.,2015-01-09,0n33QbEQZHC3ff4Gbws_ag,

SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog,Michael M. Dude, grow the f**k up. It was valentine day, you probably didn't make a reservation. Did a manager talk to you? Your picture removes all credibility  from your complaint, how old are you? 12? You're giving us young people a bad name. Good thing a respectable  and mature person would never read your review and say ""yes, this young man knows what he is talking about, I too shall not go to rigatonys ,2016-02-15,7KwVQBCAYd4c_pt8OX0ENw,

VN2cOEZNXP7S-oUQVpwAkg,Out of my 9 years expirence of the Martial Arts world I can swear infront of god I have found someone who is 120% deaducated in his Kraft ! He took me in with open arms & made me feel at home. My first day was intense & nothing less than amazing . He truly cares about his staff & students & gives a family feel to the gym. I firmly believe his training will save my life one day. I could write a book about Mr.Britt but you must see for yourself . He's going to take Krav Maga to a whole new level!,2014-04-10,JX1Wz5mQIzpRmvZuMzRYAA,

bjwzcwoddutV2aAEImhFxA,Not a good experience here at all. Do not use spa, no bathrooms, had to go to the family bathroom in my robe, inexperienced masseuse.

bjwzcwoddutV2aAEImhFxA,If you get LT BUCKS and want to use them at the LifeSpa, be aware they can only accept them in $20, $50 and $100 increments. So, if you want a $40 pedicure, you will either forfeit $10 or have to pay $20 out of pocket.  Insert eye roll here.,2015-12-23,w1U_YHQXKE34S1ddQ8AWLQ,

WQ1IKld2kUXOf0Md-p77WQ,Best place in Goodyear for a basic pedi!  They start with the normal clipping and filing.  Then they scrub the bottom of feet to remove calluses.

uQkmKBC_j9yFsXSoi7avIQ,Horrible place! I went down today to play and their airball field wasn't even blown up and none of the bunkers where tied down. No refs around to assist in games and has the 3-4 people that where there walking around without a barrel plug on in the staging area. This field has really gone down the drain!! It shows by the turn out they get on a Saturday afternoon. Best advice is to not waste your money and just take it to Xtreme paintball on Craig rd.,2013-06-08,IY1zvxpdJ4-R0kpEiCnNbg,
mEWiaX3047xoTks7jVpZKQ,Best place. To play in town other the Pahrump Paintball. Although the ref's here,well they have Ref's but its like they don't. Other then that its the best place, field wise, to play some ball at. Oh and do NOT let them touch or work on your gear! The will destroy it then hand it back asking what was wrong with it after they TRY to fix it with a dremel or something. They do not know how to tech guns there.,2013-06-08,IY1zvxpdJ4-R0kpEiCnNbg,

It was too late to cook so we ordered two pizzas, if that's what you can call them. 40 minutes later we got our two flat as pancakes, burnt miniature pizzas. We would have been better off going to dominos pizza. We're Italian so we know our Italian food. This is the worst. We'll never order food from there again.,2017-02-06,2s9CYDfbGIJI2H45201l_A,

LxPNKVBrbqIHog3MI-rkDQ,The hotel room I stayed in is old. It needs an overhaul. The carpet is dirty and stained. The front door is crooked and there is a gap between the door and frame. The bathroom wall is separating at the bottom and needs patching.  The bad part was I'm a commercial driver, but because this was Labor Day weekend, they refused to honor the commercial rate of $24 and I had to pay $130.00. I won't be staying here again unless there are improvements made.,2014-08-31,e6GCgXSra9mEHoj-_g6RDg,

shU97uo3R01v0KLlDnPaCA,This place is in the middle of nowhere. You can take an RTC bus or Duce bus for $8.00 all day pass to the strip and downtown. Goes all the way to Freemont street. Runs every 15 min until 12:30. Starts again at 8:00 for RTC. I believe Duce is 24hrs. Purchase the tickets at kiosk in terminal, credit or cash. They have restrooms open 24hrs but that's it after 8:00. I was there at 11:00 waiting for Megabus for 12:30 and kind of creepy late night. I didn't see any security.,2014-03-02,IEfx7o-rLerjG_LlWUhcwA,

I have never had the sesame mayo dressing anywhere before... and must try it at home. The Japanese lasagna is baked to perfection and the fatass roll-  crab salmon tuna and avocado deep fried comes with a spicy mayo as well.  Its hard to find decently priced good grub in summerlin.

pUUgVNS5nBSoCJsBa3fDGw,I'll start by saying I dont like sushi at all! This place was able to turn a non-sushi person into a once, sometimes twice a week customer. All I have to say is Mini Roly Katsu! This dish was to die for. But for some reason, the new Management felt it necessary to remove it from the menu. My wife left this place a long time ago when they raised the prices and changed the menu. The owner brought in new management who is trying to turn this place into Yama Sushi... Fail.

fmxRzl7RU2hFVgs5GldhHg,War am einem Samstag Mittag da und war sehr enttäuscht.

War sehr enttäuscht und kann dieses Lokal deshalb nicht empfehlen.,2014-04-08,uVCC4_g56M3I51kBCaZg4w,
CmFAIv9AzwDzka58cIJPVg,Das Mittagsbuffet ist ein Witz. War am 01.07.2014 um etwa 13:00 Uhr dort. Obwohl das Buffet bis 14:30 Uhr dauert, waren schon viele Speisen am Buffet aus und wurden nicht mehr nachgefüllt. Das, was ""Maki Mix"" genannt wird, ist frittiertes Sushi von Vortag und war für mich ungenießbar. Das Buffet und das Running Sushi am Abend sind okay, aber mittags werde ich künftig einen großen Bogen um das Ginza machen. Ganz und gar nicht zu empfehlen. Ich bin sehr enttäuscht :-(,2014-07-01,uVCC4_g56M3I51kBCaZg4w,

Worst of all, we ordered the lobsters which is on special but BE CAREFUL, they only give you one dish on special. The waitress who kept suggesting us to order the fish, which later turn out to be $149. She took our order and didn't mention to anything about the special policy they have.

eMTE-wqpk_YWaV3mf7Ii3A,So today I ordered a 15pc sashimi and a order of Mongolian beef! When I got my sashimi I was shocked, what I got was three small pc of salmon and tuna the rest was eggs? Oh and of course imitation crab! I thought I ordered sashimi not eggs. My main meal was a huge flop it was suppose to be stir fry but what I got was a deep fried batter with dried out beef jerky it was disgusting! I could not even finish half before feeling really really sick. Final thought never go there it was horrid!,2013-05-14,Tn8NJEzZbbkHqJqr2VupMA,

We used to drive out there all the time for dinner, but the new more 'fine dining' fare, if that's what you want to call it, isn't great, and frankly seems out of place in an outdoorsy\/more granola type setting.  Sometimes you just crave a marinated tofu sandwich, know what I mean?,2017-01-06,ulnIhl3W7mRYC7vqjBQimA,

dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w,DON'T EVER fly with them. Not only do they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING. i.e.: charge for carry on bags, charge for checked bags, charge for water, coffee, etc. They will cancel your flight without notice. I'd walk before I get on another Spirit flight.,2013-05-18,aPn6fTXRyQsBSyYYgu4IGw,
dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w,Really unfortunate service. Not only was our airline 40 minutes late but we had to wait another 20 minutes to board to wait for the flight attendants from another plane that hadnt gotten in yet either. While we were waiting they cancelled a different flight at the last minute.,2013-06-13,DGysyJ2OOHd38B99btHReg,

dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w,Yuck, pay the extra money and book with delta, American, or southwest. By the time they are through fee raping you, the prices with spirit versus those airlines are comparable anyways. No matter the city, state or airport, this flight is ALWAYS late. If you do have a spirit flight booked already, my tip for you is to just get to your gate an hour later than the expected departure time because odds are, it will be delayed.,2013-08-05,_5ZDPOUJ4lsMyFIJK_oNjQ,
dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w,What can I tell you about Spirit Airlines.......Oh I know, THEY FUCKIN SUCK!  My plane left 3 1\/2 hrs late departing Las Vegas going to LA and on the way back, 3 1\/2 hrs again.  They had to change the engine the first time and the second time they were late due to light drizzle.  Are their planes that shitty?  Granted the fairs are cheap, but after being charged for every piece of luggage, carryon and seat selection you total about $350.00.  Spirit is the Herpes of the airline industry.,2013-08-28,FjsDUZgcbOAvTvdG5o1O4A,

dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w,This was the worst trip ever! We were denied boarding 45min prior to departure and had to pay an extra $140 for the next flight to Vegas! On top of that they charged an extra $115 for baggage because we were 8lbs over!!! The next flight was then delayed 3 hours for maintenance issues. When we finally boarded, we realized my 6""3ft husband could barely fit his legs in the seat! This trip was definitely not worth the $296 we originally paid.,2013-11-05,I6j1Dpk2eqg8FdqBx_mzgQ,
dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w,Total trip with return baggage turned out to be almost $700. Finally, the staff is so RUDE! They speak to you very rude and short and without raising their heads to even acknowledge you.. Never Again will I use this airline!,2013-11-05,I6j1Dpk2eqg8FdqBx_mzgQ,

No. Two little meatballs for one big container of spaghetti. The meatballs are good. Their sauce\/ gravy is good. I just wish there was more meatballs.,2017-05-15,TtguHa908pVyLq3VT8XsMw,

Few hours later they called me and said sorry the actual rate is $129 with tax $150. So I was charged more and they assisted me very poorly about that. When I was asking questions they were giving vague answers. We were in Pittsburg for only 1 night and spent half my time dealing with them.

j32eLTYoQef2ehvUbxS1fg,Showboy BakeShop has managed to do something that most businesses have forgotten. They have personalized service! Every time I have been in there I am greeted warmly with a smile. I recently ordered my husbands birthday cake. I went in told Jared and Stephen that my husband worked for Leslie's pool supply and loves working on his pool at home. When I picked up the cake, I nearly started crying. Not kidding!!!! The cake was absolute perfection!!!! I am a lifelong customer!!!!!,2013-07-20,WLigJVWgCGp1a_T_6rKT9w,
aqwn3jdQLCWnb59gHK4nAw,I love this place.  The chicken is so good that you don't even need sauce but you want it!  Every sauce I have tried is good but I love the medium!  Lemon pepper rub is also good.  Portions are really good sized and most times when I ask for extra fingers, they give me more than I ask for for free!  The fingers are the way to go although you also can't go wrong with the wings.  Better than canes or any other chicken place around.,2014-04-25,alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg,

cz5vz-893D3LNH3TMQYR1w,I love the bliss burger. The staff is niceish, but the owner a total snob. Love the sitting area outside, and brunch is pretty decent as well. A little overpriced for not enough food. $9,- for a burger, $11,- if you add the bacon, and a tiny salad? $10,- for mac n cheese? Maybe if the pasta was home made. And from what I tasted, the $3,- drink special usually tastes like Nail polish & toilet water.,2013-08-11,mkzZH0GNvxgU8E7dF9w_IA,

cz5vz-893D3LNH3TMQYR1w,By far the worst dining experience I've ever had in a long time. The first time I went here, I instantly fell in love, so I sent back and took my fiancee. I ordered a different meal from the last time because I had heard great things..........well it was not pleasing to me at all. My waitress doubled around and I told her and requested to order something else, well this is when the indecency occurred.

2auigv5pF08RjJ8CL1dIVw,Visited a few weeks ago with my two kids.  My son ordered a kid's pizza for $10, he thought it was great.  I had the chicken panini with fries for $16 which I shared with my daughter. Panini was okay, but the fries were awesome!  I was very disappointed with the drink prices.  Ice teas were $6 each with no refills as they are considered mocktails... really?  No cheaper options for kids which I think is ridiculous.  For this reason alone, I am giving a lower rating.,2017-07-15,3z-xQ5UCRwOlGdwnNBU2GA,

The bugs baked into my car in the 100+ degree heat for a few days before I made it over to the pit stop. The guy actually used a hand sponge to wipe the car down before the regular routine.

This place is probably not for you if you want to fall asleep while getting a massage. With the exception of the foot portion. However it is for you if you need to get the kinks out,.

Again customer service is the worst, there are far better gyms in Las Vegas that are cheaper. Gyms where you don't have to wait to get on a machine or use equipment.

Staff was leaning on the counter and did not greet me. I had to go 3 different treadmills to find one that was somewhat clean. Equipment is very dirty. I did not even want to do floor work for abs because of how black the mats were. It's worth the drive to go to eastern and 215 or flamingo and 215 locations.,2014-09-10,0A3v7OQj1UD8GLD05Bh1pw,

I was leaving when it was really starting, & I COULDN NOT GET IN MY CAR! The guy parked another car BEYOND close to my car. He was getting out of the car, & needless to say I wasn't happy.

9dqdzRzjSfbnMvjUGqWBAw,I haven't left a restaurant due to the service in a very long time so, it's upsetting that I had to leave this dinner because of it. I have eaten here on numerous occasions, both late night and for brunch. Though it seems the service has been put last on the list.  45+ minutes for two eggs and grits on a sunday at 2pm is inconceivable with over 10 people on wait staff, and I ended up taking my order to go which had not a single thing I ordered correct, and no utensils or napkins.,2013-04-28,u-iPzwyP4p6rEoFVKrefxA,

9dqdzRzjSfbnMvjUGqWBAw,If you don't die, then that may be the best thing that happens to you from eating their food. That is if you're able to get service from their 5 waitresses that hate the world. Do yourself a favor and consider another spot, skyland is a much better choice, even Waffle House probably has fresher food. The bread tastes like rubber, their cheese is awful, their milkshakes have rotten milk, if that's not enough, they're out of everything else,2013-12-17,KfcySLrPeXNRzRzdMifowg,

And then a butterfly!!  My husband's  salmon raw in the middle. We've never been asked ""how would you like your Salmon prepared"" ugh cooked. Not how we got it. 2nd time!

Still, they were very tasty, especially the carne asada (YUM!) and chicken. Carnitas were good, too! And a good price, too!,2013-01-08,l3i6zLeC2g8oZadhXReTPg,

nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw,Well I find myself eating there alot lately. I've been there 5 or 6 times in the last week. Only on the weekend. And I'm probably going today. It's close & I like enchiladas. Good price & the customer service seems to be getting better, not that it was bad before. Maybe they recognize me? I just hope they have football on the TV & not horse jumping.,2014-10-12,luAGFdmFVobegKuaPR3byA,
nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw,At 1st I came here for convenience. The food was good. And it doesn't disappoint. The pricing is reasonable & the staff is good. The only things I wish they had is wifi & chips & salsa. I'm sure they have chips & salsa. But I don't want to pay for it. It's very good though.,2014-11-02,luAGFdmFVobegKuaPR3byA,
nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw,I have been to this restaurant a number of times & I generally order the cheese enchilada meal and it is anywhere from decent to pretty good. The last time I got a breakfast burrito with a side of rice. The burrito was good & inexpensive & rice was good, however the rice was extremely overpriced as you can see in the picture. I  go there because it is close to where I live. But I would NOT go out of my way to go there. Not because the food is bad, but because other places are better 4 the same $,2014-12-11,luAGFdmFVobegKuaPR3byA,

nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw,Good food, good pricing, ok customer service. Today the rice isn't cooked as good as it usually is. They charged my card for $10.39 when the bill was $8.66 & she can't figure out why that happened & didn't offer any solution or an attempt at a resolution. I got the shrimp street tacos. Good as always. Just the rice is not nearly as good as usual. I think it's over cooked? It's hard.,2015-05-22,luAGFdmFVobegKuaPR3byA,

qBvBYX-9HMbZvMB8x5JSzw,I've been getting my hair cut at A&B for over a year now and even though I've recently moved, it's well worth the drive to get it done right every time.  One time, I was on a lunch break and needed a quick haircut, so I dropped in and Stan got me in and out in less than 30 minutes without compromising quality.

During the summer we would bike all of the Cleveland Heights parks and go over to Ski Hill and ride down the hill. I must admit many a bike were ruined and of course we never told our parents how it happened. I moved back to Cleveland Heights when our kids were 4 yo and 7 yo. They have great friends and adventures. I even took them sledding to ski hill our 1st winter here,2017-09-04,ESLPNSXmYOF4CSxFN7ZDxg,

TBavvwiKAugsXyV8kzvvmA,What kind of theatre doesn't refund a ticket when there are service disruptions? Went to watch a tamil movie and they only accept debit\/credit for hindi movies? We waited to get into the movie then we found out there is a fire disruption. Waited over an hour and half to find out whether the movie will be played or we will be getting a refund. In the end walked out, disappointed with no refund or no movie. No wonder this place is losing business.,2015-11-13,9m7ns3mPPc9bFbJMhaXkLA,

C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,I always eat here. Every time with my boyfriend. We found a plastic piece from a bread bag in our butter and no one cams over and offered anything. It was very matter of fact and no importance to customer service or value at all. It's sad because we will now need to find a new breakfast place to eat. Wish their customer service was a bit better.,2013-05-27,bZG8nXwxPogg10Vg-ntAOQ,

C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A,This was a far trek but well worth it! I always say if the bread in the beginning is good, then the whole meal should be amazing. The pot of bread lived up to its hype and I would recommend definitely choosing that over the biscuits and toast. I ordered the chicken and waffles and I must say, Roscoe has a lot of competition on his hands. My boyfriend ordered the steak and chilaquiles and it bursted with flavor.

I did ask for a new one, and they came back with a SLIGHTLY less cooked one. The service was great, ill give them that. But if you like your burger cooked the way you like the first time, you need to be VERY clear. Overall the bar itself is nice, but nothing special.

zhqurYCKYSCZmIEtus1Mzw,So imagine our surprise when the replacement for a covered road hazard still cost me sixty bucks because they only cover $125 for a tire! I bought an off road vehicle for a reason; and the warranty they push and push doesn't even cover the price of the standard tire that comes with the vehicle. And no other Jeep dealership has ever heard of this warranty and almost weren't willing to accept it! I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone.,2013-04-08,zGj5SEGCeTlaaM0-8ZBjlQ,
zhqurYCKYSCZmIEtus1Mzw,Oh, and we walked in, told them exactly what we wanted, and it still took them 8 hours to get us out the door...and they didn't even bother to wash my car.,2013-04-08,zGj5SEGCeTlaaM0-8ZBjlQ,

Rnv_6-AKhvXjKRqUSX09gQ,Towne Square is 1 of 2 places where the apt was nice enough & the staff kind, to get me to re-sign a lease in 12 yrs of renting.  I like the whole staff, they are very easy to work with.  You can swim in January because the pool is heated (I do wish it was heated a little, in the other months).  It's a dog friendly complex, w\/o being  gross from people not cleaning up.  My neighbors are amazing!  Only con: I couldn't sign a longer lease!

Rnv_6-AKhvXjKRqUSX09gQ,DO NOT MOVE HERE!!! These apartments leak with every rain storm or sprinkle. Everything breaks and no one in the office or corporate care about you. If you can't pay rent and have MORE THAN HALF but need more time for the remainder they do not care and will not have any sympathy or remorse for you and your family. They don't keep up on the buildings either if something is broken they tell maintenance to put a bandaid on it. This place is A SHIT HOLE!!!!!,2017-08-28,xrHRG_9EjQLCgs_fETi-Bw,

I use this option 2-3 times a week - my order has always been ready on time, and accurate, and it's an easy way to earn\/redeem rewards. It also makes it easier to customize your order, which is a draw for me because I tend to be picky.

xBIG_S0i6DuioEvPM2kxMg,The tip is to AVOID this place like no other. There is no follow through from day 1 - deposit being returned. They have a high turnover of leasing agents so good luck dealing with the same person consistently. And apparently Ali's phone doesn't make outgoing phone calls. You are supposed to get your deposit back within 14 days but I'm at 25 days right now and still can't get an answer. Seems to me they consistently dodge people, lie and delay in returning your money.,2017-01-06,JkZhkcLnJS6-9vxTUKTcIQ,

K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg,Came on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Very disappointing this time around. I used to be a huge fan of their separate dishes and especially of their Mac n cheese dishes. They removed them completely and instead put in a Mac n cheese bar. Sounds good, right? It's so much worse than their pre-made Mac. The only thing I enjoyed tonight was the 5 spice pork belly. Very lacking in the veggies and no sausages whatsoever. Only this ""homemade"" sausage, which wasn't even. Very disappointed.,2013-11-30,JAk9ZsDAzZo5FMfEgqj9ZQ,

I go to pay and she asks if to go or stay so I said stay and she said, I can't charge you here... I was confused! she said I can only sit down if I order a drink. I sat down and the waiter passed me by at least 10 times and never asked me anything. Terrible.

Too often I see people just hovering around the concessions stand waiting for an employee instead of just asking. That goes for carts too, if your seatbelt doesn't feel right or you just want to know how to get that much faster, don't be nervous to just ask!,2015-08-17,a55nTPMh1v5haZoZ7PqJYA,

They told us 15 minutes to wait, we ended up waiting almost an hour and a half. Then the lady that did my pedicure was very rough and didn't stop when I told her she was hurting me. She then decided to rinse off my legs and got water all over my chair and my shorts. She also did not massage my legs or feet at all. I will never return to this spa again!!!,2013-06-15,l3rYQ_ajtnzD9wZFCUd1jQ,

Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,How hard is a spicy tuna hand roll? I ordered that and a spicy salmon hand roll, both sucked. I had much better at my nearby grocery store. The ginger they served  came with a dead fruit fly, nice touch. I tried to save the night with salmon sashimi that was cut the size of a quarter, and had no taste.They could even get a spicy ponzu sauce correct. Avoid this nightmare and get sushi from Albertson or Von's it will be 10x better.,2013-06-03,OOBmM5L8yZUN5E5GL0cOsw,

When doing general cleaning they only used water. I called the owner to complain and aked him to call homeowner directly to rectify things.

BtLDbNfpwdwHSmyBJF2-RQ,A top restaurant north of the 407. Strong menu of fish, meat and pasta.  The gnocchi in mushrooms was rich in umami flavours. The fish trio was well seasoned with the tuna making the best impression.  The fennel and rockets salad paired acid very well with the fish.   A lava cake for dessert with port and a latte left us with a complete experience.   The best attribute?   The service.  Outstanding wait staff and perfect delivery of each course.  Could use some more wine options by the glass.,2013-06-12,O8gSM0fmRTtIJw3DRRFqbA,

When I confronted her she got angry and accused me of wanting to get service done for free! Worst customer service and the nails that she said were so called done chipped to this within 5 days. They also have a shortage of help and to keep your business, they will sit you and start you and then leave you for 10 minutes and do someone else.Would not recommend.,2017-07-03,aFT4JK5Hs2qVJwW2KyocIw,

kfpaN4ookWht6XgJjGhHkg,Bad experience here tonight. Three of us ordered burgers all cooked the same - medium. Mine came late and after I got one bite in, I saw burger was raw on inside. I sent it back. Rather than cook a new one they put the raw one back on grill, seared the edges and brought it back. They literally threw it on the table and quickly left table.

1ygl2K40akubzIK6dGvQ_A,Compared to other West Indian (Guyanese Chinese) restaurants in the GTA I give this restaurant a 5\/10. The only thing I could speak positively about is their food. The service in this dine ""restaurant"" absolutely sucks. In comparison to the other east end restaurant Island Mix is Pickering there is no comparison in service.

But for a regular neighbourhood, I-feel-like-some-good-but-reasonable-sushi place, Nikko is tough to beat. Strengths: Spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls - really, really good. Miso soup - maybe the best I've ever had. Weaknesses: Shrimp rolls are a bit dry; sashimi is sometimes uneven. But honestly: If you live in the area, this is an absolute hidden gem.

The trick now is they tell prospective landlords who call for verification etc. That you were evicted. .. even when you're still living there just to force you to re-sign. We were never late,  never even had a noise complaint and the place we are trying to get into said mesa club says you were being evicted.  Wait... no I'm out in 2 months because that's when my lease is up. Staff says nothing we can do.  Too bad. Tune to go to the news station.,2014-02-06,BZaKnCbDCzwVphYvS5-b7Q,

But after dealing with the company directly(Paul no longer with co.),  I would definitely recommend giving them a second chance. They had a service man come out the same day we called and was completely reasonably priced for what needed repaired. Having a car with car seats in AZ it was important to get service immediately.  Good service. Reasonable priced and efficient.  Deserves 2nd chance.,2014-05-24,Nwhmv1IRCkdoqDCA_9lEkQ,

The staff was pleasant and friendly, walk me through the menu and offered combo suggestions. They even offered sauce samples to try-out before placing my order. The wings were great. The ""Hot & Sweet"" flavor was great. Good price standpoint. They charge by pound, not by pieces. Approximately 7 to 8 wings per pound (big wings).
