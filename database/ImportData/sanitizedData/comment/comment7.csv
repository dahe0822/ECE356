Tc1ly-0VLk3AaoMb7CrlVA,Breakfast burrito had a good portion of steak, could have used more eggs, came with mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese, and mild salsa inside.

I've really enjoyed watching 'Deadly Possession' on the travel Channel with Zak interviewing many of the famous haunted possessions that were donated by there owners. Zak - you are very articulate and well-spoken.  I appreciate the questions you ask and answers you are able to get from the interviewees. I admire your intelligence, respect and seriousness about these particular artifacts. Thank you, Candace,2017-09-22,tuW0YBJyIlkinO_v73V5ZQ,

Then there was the hidden gem in the middle - a cold piece of sausage  Wonder how that got there? And the utensils and side plates were dirty. Pasta was good, but not great. Really don't get the 4-star rating.,2014-05-10,tkTQ7BS7fiMw_Eeosxl58g,

MFbyWskON6pqRp5-K4hIKw,Food just as good as in any chick fil a, expected.  Location is convenient but VERY poor planning in terms of drive-thru situation, parking. I love that it's close to home but many will opt to go elsewhere just due to the traffic situation alone--really, a drive through line directed towards the Sports authority parking lot?? Also, management should have thought to place experienced ppl at this locale to open & get things settled while  training new employees at established locations.Just saying,2013-08-12,h1mn5DaKLOinuif6XrbRtw,

z8fxtoAxCgfGad2lBJCcWQ,I have been coming here for a long time something like 7yrs maybe longer.  The guys here are awesome. They know how to cut hair and they remember how I like it everytime I come in. I like when they finish cutting my hair they put a hot towel on  my head and give a short power massage.

ajoqEHnCZTD8-8GqGLq9-Q,The Palms has a reputation as a party place for the young and beautiful, but as a hotel its quite lacking. No easy breakfast place. No shuttle from the airport?

The beds are very hard... repeat the beds are very hard. Housekeeping emptied the trash, but did not make the bed. The pool is smaller than it looks in the picture. The bar at the pool as well as the restaurant on property have closed. Wow.

dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg,The food is always really good and the portions are huge. However, the kitchen has no idea what it means to bring the meal out together or what it means to be fast. Servers are no better. Our server brought our cheesy garlic bread and my husband's pizza out at the same time. When we were done with the garlic bread and the pizza, they finally got my mushrooms out. This was after the manager, not the waiter, came over and asked if everything was okay.

OEfvfMCJyC5kRWeRQQYQMg,The mall has gone through a lot of changes since I first started coming here in its newly opened phase in 1997. Most of the businesses I frequented are long gone or has changed ownership, and there really isn't anything of interest for me to buy anymore (other than drinks at Presotea), but it still holds a lot of memories for me and I like coming here for old time's sake.,2015-07-14,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
IRd0jvnfJ3tV6AMlYMajzw,Pulled tea (teh tarik) here is amazing - strong tea flavor yet smooth. Foodwise, I find the food a bit over seasoned - peanut sauce was very sweet; assam laksa was very salty even before the optional side of shrimp paste was added. Decor is much nicer than Gourmet Malaysia but I prefer the food at GM.,2017-06-23,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
IRd0jvnfJ3tV6AMlYMajzw,No luck in convincing the chef to specially make an off menu item (roti tisu) for me. According to our server, roti tisu is only made specially for owner's friends.

XmgdFa3G_CZVfjtQEJMZfQ,I'm not much of a meat eater but my Jewish husband, a big time carnivore loves the smoked meat here, especially ordered fatty. The cabbage borscht on the menu helped settle the disagreement between husband and myself that borscht does not have to be made with beets! Matzo ball soup here wasn't the best and kreplach is not on the menu, but it's still my husband's favorite kosher style deli in Toronto!,2016-07-10,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
uBmJygqjv9YuhwGD5WjDww,I usually come for the chocolate. Macarons and other pastries were beautiful to look at, but not spectacular in terms of taste and texture.,2016-12-18,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
aervNtqzrKf0CGrFo4xfKw,Family dinner at my favorite Quebecois French restaurant.  Steak au poivre is as good as it was in its original location.  So children frendly that it even has a separate menu for children under 12 (with at least 4 entree choices too).,2012-08-17,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
zXuWHM45eDmW04CaDbQfKg,A Jamaican friend introduced this take-out joint to me in the 90s, and I've been hooked ever since. Even after moving away, I still return for a meal or two when I'm back in Toronto for a visit. Favorites include jerk chicken, curry chicken and spicy beef patties. Too bad the chicken fricassee I had back in the day disappeared from the menu. Owners were Hakka Chinese from Jamaica, and it looks like their son (?) is running the business now (or it was sold to another Chinese Jamaican family).,2014-05-06,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,

semizMsHqDfT_kOXQITSOA,Food is nothing to get excited over here (low quality meat, sloppy preparation that the crusts were left uncut on the sandwiches), though I feel nostalgically attached to this once popular hangout for HK high schoolers in the mid to late 80s. Even the décor hasn't changed much since the 80s, despite one or several possible ownership changes.,2015-06-25,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
IvFdi-vp823dTAWwHMT6xQ,Restaurant owned by the founder of the original Dickens Cafe, a Hong Kong style cafe in Richmond Hill. As a result, one is better off to stick with HK style cafe classics like curries, as opposed to other dishes that try too hard to be real ""western"" dishes but failed. Hong Kong style ""borscht"" soup was made much too sweet here.,2014-10-23,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
Eoj4-cffvbIQxLTO-C_K0g,Restaurant will serve its last lunch of the year on 12\/19\/14, and re-open again on 1\/6\/15. So much for my plans to have lunch with my daughter there during the holidays. :-(,2014-11-20,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,

Eoj4-cffvbIQxLTO-C_K0g,Visitors to Toronto, don't miss the opportunity to experience this well hidden gem where judges and legal professionals dine, in a classically decorated dining area with its walls surrounded by law books. Do keep in mind that you have to go through security to reach the restaurant as it is located inside Osgoode Hall, the building that houses the highest courts of the province. It's open only for lunch during work weeks, and closed for a few months in the summer and a few weeks around Christmas.,2017-04-16,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
4yl6W0DCdw2VvSmwgGE8dg,Name says China but definitely more Hong Kong-ish (as is the rest of Toronto although the mainlanders' influence has been growing stronger each year).

Rclse_6pgM1RUrEps2-wtQ,I have not been a resident of Toronto since 1999 but each time I visit, I do my best to make it here at least once or twice because: (1) there is no place that offers this type of dessert in SoCal (my current residence), (2) there is no place in GTA and nearby that offers my two favs here, taro & yam sago delight (芋香蕃薯西米露) and purple sticky rice with taro and small mochi balls (香芋紫米小丸子).,2015-07-21,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,

avO3ankzZIsTMSKQdznZMw,While I love macarons and Cake Opera makes some of the most beautifully shaped ones, its cupcakes are much better in terms of taste. It uses Italian meringue buttercream frosting - less sweet and more rich and smooth than the standard buttercream frosting.,2012-08-10,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,

zs421MgnmjEeSesfgXNItQ,Back in the 80s, my uncle from Belgium would bring to us a ballotin each time he visited.

wGwib7KvPzs5_6aPCk_Fzw,Macaron stop #5 this trip. Great selection of my favorite tea\/floral flavors (Earl Grey; lavender; matcha; rose berry) @ $27 for 12.

tgjbQEtZ_bvQBJOlfiK1OA,One of very few places opened on Christmas day. Hava nagila was playing when we were there. :-) Service was great, if a bit slow. Great menu for pescartarians - sfiha (fish kebabs), grilled whole fresh catch of the day (branzino on day of our visit), Chilean sea bass masabaha, etc. Paella contains chicken and was a bit too ""wet"" for my liking.,2014-12-28,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,

The ambiance, experience, food and service were all memorable, and well worth the $200+ per person charge.

dnLP0IhzWXiJBk4J6GTxmg,Small Chinese shopping center with businesses ranging from the usual bakery, Chinese bookstore, Chinese herb stores, electronics and computer accessories shops, candy\/snack shop, hair salon, lingerie shop, optical store, acupuncturist, esthetician, florist, massage therapist, optometrists, tailors, travel agents, to something as random as a store for house slippers.,2015-07-20,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
oKfiAU3X4C2chk6DJdKPAQ,Waffle cones\/bowls are made on premises - good but not as good as Old Firehall Confectionery's (Unionville). Double scoops on waffle cone or waffle bowl for four people came to a drop over $30 after taxes.,2015-07-19,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
oKfiAU3X4C2chk6DJdKPAQ,I've been to Dutch Dreams at its original\/present locations a total of 3\/ 4 times and have never had to wait in line, probably because I went during the week at non-peak times (early afternoon). Sad to see some of the iconic decor (garden gnomes, face of man w\/ blue hat, etc.) from the original location missing at its current location, but happy that the seating area is less cramped w\/ more natural lighting in the new location.,2015-07-19,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
RwRNR4z3kY-4OsFqigY5sw,Matcha cheesecake coming soon in August. Until then, this side is still a great place to pick up a madeleine, slushy or soft cream (soft serve ice cream) with little wait in case you decided to give up on the line next door, or if you came with someone who is holding the line for you next door.,2015-07-24,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
RwRNR4z3kY-4OsFqigY5sw,Waited about 1 hour 20 mins on a Friday evening (@7:30 p.m., 7\/24\/15, Pan Am Games week) for the cheesecake, because I didn't have luck at the Front Street Foods stall after 2 tries. Was it worth the hype? Maybe not, though it was still a pretty good cheesecake and fun experience with my 11 year old as part of our TO adventure as tourists. I've had my fair share of Japanese cheesecakes before and this was one of the lightest and natural tasting (bland for some).,2015-07-24,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
RwRNR4z3kY-4OsFqigY5sw,If you didn't like your first few bites of the cheesecake, give it a second chance after placing it in the refrigerator for 3 hours, for an altered taste and texture. The result may be better or worse depending on your preference but it doesn't hurt to give it a try, right?,2015-07-24,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
LiY0vRXMWrjUrXQr2Z_D4A,Being married to a NY born\/bred Jewish American, I've had my fair share of Jewish fare and frequent Ashkenazi Jewish eateries every year I visit TO w\/ the hubby. It's better than the lacking kosher style deli scene where we live (OC, CA), but not our favorite of similar style restaurants we frequent in Toronto and York Region. Smoked meat was a bit less juicy than what hubby prefers. Liked the not overly sweet cabbage rolls but mom-in-law said it needed to be sweeter. Warm and friendly service.,2016-07-10,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,
s-S2xzhmyWw7TUDet7WBnQ,Cheesecakes at the Uncle Tetsu stall were completely sold out at 2:00 p.m. on a Tuesday (7\/21\/15). Matcha madeleines were available with no set limit @ $3 a piece, with a buy 3 get 1 free promotion.,2015-07-22,LrHXiTC5j2CavyJuEUnITA,

SY8ATrwxQJf699wyFRUqgA,After spending a day talking to Rudi and his sales Manger via email. We had agreed on a price on a car I liked and have driven in the past. It was to be a 1,2,3 deal. Drove from Gilbert to Phoenix only to walk out few min later. They took out the video monitorscreams and car was not the clean CPO it was advertised. Also they wanted to raise the price.

Then charged me $18 for the diagnosis which I already new. then owner suggested I just not pay the $18 fee because the trimmer wasn't worth it since it wasn't working.

7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA,My whole family (w a couple picky eaters + me, vegan) enjoyed this place. Good food- might take awhile or have an awkward server (albeit always personable and well-meaning). Overall, a good local Italian joint- not the mass-market broad-appeal of Olive Garden, but a more homey, yet still accommodating pizza place. This is the place you want to patronize- a local pizza place, making good food, who also go out of their way to cater to vegan and\/or gluten-free folks.,2016-04-30,hB216b7iW-pEAUuAXS41Tw,

Ko Sin is decent brunch buffet for the price but a let down with high expectations I had.

1qwkbN3wu3AGDxMTXVz2gA,If you're going in a Sat, go after 8 when the crowds have died down. We arrived around 6 to a line out the door, and a two hour wait for a bay.

I get back $2, look at my receipt and ask the cashier to reconfirm the total. ""$7.55"" she says. Puzzled, I look at the $2 in my hand and the receipt that clearly says change: $2.45. Houston we have a problem. Then she asks, ""Did you want that?"" Uh, duh! GIVE ME ALL MY CHANGE PLEASE! Where do they do that at?! Apparently there! Be careful folks.
