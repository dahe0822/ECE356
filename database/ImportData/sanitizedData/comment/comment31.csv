98YzjvO45DRRvqrNv0hhAA,Streetcars are completely unreliable, you can't purchase tokens with debit cards at TTC stations, you can't purchase monthly passes unless it's the start of the month, or weekly passes unless it's the start of the week. This, when in London you can use your debit card paypass to tap on in buses and can buy a weekly or monthly pass at any point.

PotiAhtDMYMNsJCzV0oLAw,Know what you're going in there to get and stick to it, because Walmart deals are so good you might walk out with more than you plan on getting. Lol,2014-05-21,NOX1s6dROvRjXWZfg0ZFJA,
eXw22FQ7jv3Ma2kqfI3Lrg,When you come to a dealership, make sure you've  done your research on the car you really want. Visit truecar.com and see what the average customer pays for that car, print it and see what dealership will match it. Don't try to get a discount on that ""truecar"" price because you might not get it, then you will be mad at the dealership because they can't go in the hole for you to buy the car. Find a sales rep that will treat you right and is knowledgeable about the product, then buy from them.,2014-05-19,NOX1s6dROvRjXWZfg0ZFJA,

I don't know what that glaze on my chicken was but it was NOT the amazing buffalo sauce I usually get. It was like a hint of buffalo with ketchup. The sauce was tacky. So gross.

4POPYEONJpkfhWOMx_PyGg,Definitely a good place but I still prefer barbarian over this one. Appetizers are huge so don't order a lot if you want to enjoy your steak. Steaks were good but nothing exceptional that you would die for. We had porterhouse and bone in rib. The former was served even almost cold. Sides are all good and huge. You can order sides as half portion to try more options. Staff are friendly and nice. I recommend barbarian before trying this steakhouse and you'll see the difference yourself.,2014-08-09,JoMxHFRCJL8CS-VJ4Qjo8w,

Km9IPMrNPEnn40ebgxs6vw,Stopped in for a quick bite and little espresso zinger as a shopping break. Was curious about this stone oven bagel taste. Interesting little cafe love the down to earth vibe and possibly the best music ever! The herb salmon creme cheese was very flavourful, punch you in the face flavour. I probably should have ordered it on a different bagel. The sesame bagel was sweet and subtle. I would avoid getting the espresso, very flat and not at all tasty. Overall good place to grab a quick bagel!,2016-01-10,kFEvOU4Ry0it6WdXXH9rLA,

64gtZKZL3gA_CO2zJwvSog,US Airways SUCKS! every time I have ever flown US Airways via Charlotte, something stupid happens and today is no exception. My connection to Charlotte is cancelled bcuz they have no flight crew! Is that serious? Who is running this company,a bunch of drunken squirrels? They have no other flights until 10:30 tonite..it is 10:30 am.. so they expect me to sit in this airport for 12 hours. The customer service is awful. No empathy, no solution.. SUCKS,2014-03-07,mT5BT_BcE-3x_zWo_Fqmvg,
u6xb2aUAvX6i1WhsQWqgWg,My friends and I ordered alot just to taste. The shrimp and grits were ok. The shrimp was good, but they didnt seaaon the grits so it made the entire meal kind of bland. The,waffles were delish! The highlight of the meal. The fried chicken and fried cod were great. My cousin said her chicken salad was really good. The salmon croquettes were too thick so didnt seem cooked well enough all the way through. The service was GREAT! The music was too loud,2014-01-19,mT5BT_BcE-3x_zWo_Fqmvg,

Needless to say, the piercing is completely swollen and infected now. I realize that I should have said something but I personally figured there would have been standards they followed.

Nu2CMMUeGH6sSzlmwnFY1Q,To help ease digestion of meals, did you know it is actually best to avoid consuming fluids while eating? Drinking fluid during a meal will dilute your stomach acid and disrupt\/delay digestion, making you feel fuller faster and even give you that ""bloat"" feel. Instead, try this simple tip: drink a glass of water upon waking up, 30-minutes prior to each meal, and 30-minutes prior to bedtime (will aid in sleep, burning calories, cleansing the body of toxins and can even help prevent strokes)!,2014-12-15,1ZLlPgooNbdQtCpDeo3SgA,
Nu2CMMUeGH6sSzlmwnFY1Q,Tip:  If you're not working out with Charlotte RIPS and you live in Charlotte, or even if you don't live in Charlotte, you are truly missing out on a friendly and intimate workout environment. Everything is 1-on-1 or small group related, no gym sales, no pesky staff, no waiting for machines....just pure enjoyment. You won't find another place like Charlotte RIPS and it's worth trying out, especially when you're first visit is free.,2015-11-21,1ZLlPgooNbdQtCpDeo3SgA,
Nu2CMMUeGH6sSzlmwnFY1Q,Maximize your body's daily capability by drinking at least half your body weight in ounces (ex. 160lb person = 80oz of water daily). Water intake will literally make or break your physical and mental performance.,2014-12-11,1ZLlPgooNbdQtCpDeo3SgA,

9BohUwW-fTfcpiBT782Fkg,There's a LOT of stuff on these sandwiches, so while a medium sub usually seems like the ""average"" size, it's actually extremely filling from here (hence the $8 price tag that comes with it)!

I do recommend getting their pizzas well done to ensure a crispier crust.  Staff is great, quality control is great, love the place.

WOz66UuVsfc2K9GxzfDnGg,Heard so much about this taco shop place. Lacks tremendous customer service and the food was just blah! Horcharta drink was very good, one of the best I've tried in a while. I would not return to this place. I got the 2 for $20 deal: 2 pastor tacos and 2 carne asada burritos; carne asada was not good at all; pastor was good. Salsa for chips: was asked to pick wither medium or hot and i ordered hot; wouldnt want to know what the medium was like?? ketchup based? Will definitely not return.,2013-08-12,nAju4rK_9JLiAXenmzwXBQ,

MTaUKiq8TgQ5SD0RrQQtJA,Do NOT eat here. Hot bar lunch went from $6.99\/lb to $7.99\/lb, quality went WAY down. Today's ""roast"" chicken tastes like they cooked it in the same oil as fish. They put cherry tomatoes in ALL beans & veggies (weird and not good). ""Stewed"" carrots still raw. Cauliflower and broccoli are mushy. All veggies very bland! They use previous days'\/meals' leftovers to create ""new"" entrées by mixing with other things and maybe spices. Sad.

No rollaway options and only twin size beds available.   they should knock this dump of a hotel down and require it to have Hilton standards.

MpmFFw0GE_2iRFPdsRpJbA,Make sure you find the promoter that can put you on the right guest list that provides stamps to allow you into the dance floor instead of restricting you to only have access in the pool area. Lesson learned. There are other night clubs on the Rise that is better than XS with access to the dance floor instead of categorizing people into diff list with access to different areas. I don't understand why they would do that. Who would just want to go in there and not be able to go to the dance floor?,2015-07-13,gPvITpGSDLgTY9nzOLUj4g,

PbTh7aX0_yyaXFOXAlhI4A,Well, so far the service is so far beyond unacceptable that I would never recommend this place to anyone.

PbTh7aX0_yyaXFOXAlhI4A,Turf has\/had Smithwicks, an Irish red ale, and my favorite beer, last time I was there in Dec of 2010. Both it and its sister public house, Seamus, have a good ambiance and staff. I'm still looking for lamb dishes-- have to go to Ireland for split grilled lamb kidneys with bacon and potatoes for breakfast I suppose. Don't let that  dissuade you though, it probably won't if you're not used to lamb\/mutton, because it's an easy spot to enjoy yourself,2013-08-11,CJ2itrt6tgiZzVu69u13yA,

WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,The valet is terrible. There's no option to self park here. You can't call down for them to get your car. We asked them to leave the car out front bc we were coming back down in 15 mins. The response was 'I can't do that'. When asked why, the response 'it's to our discretion. If you're just running up to get luggage we can'. My response 'I guess my Tesla isn't good enough to sit out here with that Lexus IS that's been out front for the last 2 days'.. If you're gonna lie, please do a better job.,2014-11-08,P4sEdJm3ad1J3r7gE5qylA,

WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,alet is a huge issue! & they don't have self parking. We came during one of the busiest times of the year, so you would think they were better prepared. Instead, they had minimal amount of workers, they checked out our car without authorization, then lost it; took them 2 hours to find it! If you have a flight to catch or any plans, make sure you have enough time in case it's packed, or they check out your car without authorization and then lose it.,2016-06-20,L3xMvAU8z6UCHpi3YtIwMw,

I recommend getting the egg rolls for appetizers (at $1 a piece and they are definitely homemade daily!) really good meal as well, I got the one in the picture closest to the phone for $8 (rice included). Unlike most restaurants where if you eat the entire plate you are stuffed, if you eat the entire plate here you are satisfied but not stuffed full.  Perfect rationing IMO.

jEABBfAVPPY0BcVxlRatGg,This place is always quiet, especially in comparison to the nearby bbt places in the area such as chatime and real fruit, so this place is perfect for a quick grab and go (I personally love their wintermelon creama). However, because of the infrequency of customer visits, sometimes their bubbles aren't as fresh as I'd like them to be.  I'd normally get other toppings that won't change in texture the longer they've been sitting out, such as the herb jelly (which is pretty darn delicious).,2016-06-10,yViMmyZcyCtBa8D7uGryaQ,

t5BbHrIWJj6fu2j6IeS-SQ,We took our 4 yr old boxer to see the vet in township in nc. He has a growth on his eyelid. It popped up suddenly and has grown and a tremendous rate. They looked him over and gave us a estimate for $2500. To have the mass removed and reconstruct his eyelid. Plus they freaked us out saying it was cancer. Of course thus us way out if our budget. We then went to another vet and they looked at it took some cells and looked under the microscope and no cancer just a hystiocytoma. Google it.,2013-07-03,FI267apiNYPa2fQjWa4RpQ,
t5BbHrIWJj6fu2j6IeS-SQ,Boxers are prone to get these. Something a vet should know right away. Needless to say it cost only $200. To have this done. How can a company that treats animals want to rip off family's? They made us feel awful cuz we couldn't afford the $2500. Please do not take ur pet here. Only in it for money and want to RIP u off.,2013-07-03,FI267apiNYPa2fQjWa4RpQ,

t5BbHrIWJj6fu2j6IeS-SQ,It should be expected that CVS is expensive.. they are a specialized surgery and emergency facility. For surgery, you're using a doctor who performs a specialized surgery several times a week vs your primary vet who maybe does it a few times a year.  Get dog health insurance (healthy paws).

4V2KN03EJMzaoOmLOy5UhQ,My tip is this.....if you are a woman, think twice before patronizing this bar, the security staff is not helpful and will not have any problems being physical,  even with women.  Just read other posts.   I posted a comment on this bar on yelp and the manager is now texting me threats to sue me because i expressed my experience,  on a public forum, created to do just what i did.  I think a tip would be to care more about how your patrons feel after a bad experience and treat them better.,2016-03-29,Q2i96pLG_oPq75LXidqtyg,

Salad needs to be dried and the bins are always empty resolving in smaller portions. The employee's don't care most of the time they are annoyed and careless with the food they are dishing up.

Which is a real bummer b\/c other places, like Matador, have never said no to me (since I was also a regular there).
