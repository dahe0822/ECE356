There is smoking at the pool, but you can take a dip, exchange the towels, and move locations away from the cigar smokers around you.  Ninja skills preferred, but not required.

F-uWjXd5thbbcx8m26X9hw,I have had many bad experiences with the SPD--this includes ignoring a problem I called in. Not only are they an eye-sore to see driving around, I know they aren't protecting me from anything. Tonight, I was driving my daughter home on the 101 S near Shea. An officer in an SUV swerved into the HOV lane behind me, started flashing his brights at me, and when I moved into the next right lane, he flew by me flashing his blue and red lights and honking his horn. Is this keeping me safe?,2014-05-26,vBUIiElKb8aonFZ4nZGUZg
SSRRQm8tGCmXXbt3las2Ww,I work at a local cafe that has gluten-free bread from GFC. After trying the bread, I was amazed at how good it actually was... Today, I stopped in to get an iced coffee and I took the red velvet pancake to-go so I could enjoy them at the park next door. The coffee is good, freshly brewed, the pancakes are such a treat. I did t even need syrup, it's literally like eating the top of a cupcake. Do not let the lack of decoration or the location fool you! I will definitely stop in more often.,2014-04-07,vBUIiElKb8aonFZ4nZGUZg

oW8d40D4y7bISFDHKcVYzg,If you're going to the ER you should show up prepared with some pillows, a good book or some movies on your iPad, some snacks, and a bed for your pet.  You'll get to see the Vet fairly quickly, but after that, get ready to wait! And I mean wait longer than you've ever waited..for the Vet to come back into the room to talk to you again, and for your discharge papers.  Hours!!! They are so slow and inefficient that you will probably thank me for warning you to prepare yourself for this visit.,2017-10-24,N6CS_pw3KPvaNa2CptEnwg

tu7cmFBfKVFKtJvRPHOxbg,Prices increased at this location and there is not appropriate labeling or signage. When you read the menu board, it is incorrect and reflect the old prices. A #8 increased by almost $2.50. But because the price isn't labeled, they can pretty much charge you whatever they want and there is zero accountability.

5iKJB6oU-JoaZs5yzqd34g,Hello to all. I'm a single Father of 2 girls. I went here cause I thought it was a accredited place to go to. It was  a mistake. I was lied to from the get go. The car I wanted they told me was out of my range ,but yet still sold me a car that cost the same amount as the one I wanted. Also they have you sign all your documents electronically so you can't see what they are putting into your contract. Not to mention I put down $2500 which they made disappear. Do not go here, go elsewhere please.,2017-08-29,c3idVgxiz6x74ORMYUH1Eg

6dKhlb7yx_mKeInETrnglQ,Do not go here. At the beginning of the service they told me one price & when I went to pay it was a different price (ten dollars more) I had been here many times and NEVER paid that price. They also cut me so badly during the manicure that I bled all over the place. I think they cut a vein bc it would not stop bleeding.  They cut my boyfriends toe & he is in pain today wearing his boots to work. I bled onto a magazine & they didn't even toss it. Just wiped it off a put it back! There was no sry,2014-05-21,SXRbUA5owryGkn9UcLChZw
6dKhlb7yx_mKeInETrnglQ,CONT. no apology.  She insisted I must have done it and that was not blood on her tool but red polish. Weird bc it wasnt there before. She said ""its not us. U cut yourself another way"" what?! I was so confused. I paid the higher price than what they told me in the beginning and left. It was crazy,2014-05-21,SXRbUA5owryGkn9UcLChZw

Then it takes them days to correct the issue. When it is their mistake they have no urgency to correct it. You are not a priority. Their customer care is non-existent.

They break things then try to make you pay for it.

I paid for motor mounts, 3 months later my new mechanic said they weren't even bolted down to the engine!!!!!,2014-05-06,w4u_WHCtnl-VV785Q9kpHg

The waitress is a snob. Food finally came after an hour. Garlic parmesan fries came with our meal instead of before & had to be sent back to actually have garlic & parmesan put on them.

MjGvGVvYV5WBVU2eGF1F7A,In the deli they have restrictions to what you can have in your personal meals, even though if you bought it separately at 1\/ 8th of a pound,  equates to a serving size, and is cheaper.  Sometimes you just don't want coleslaw as a side for your meal. Sometimes, you just want crab salad, or potato salad. If you are going to have a meal, and like variety, don't get the meal, order the food individually because it's the only way they can think past the cost for some reason.,2016-09-14,nYSoK4ck0e39KxGWWoalGQ

They'lll tell you that you qualify for a study then after days or weeks they'll change their mind and say you weren't a good enough candidate & will drop you and NOT pay you after you spent your money driving there sometimes 2 or 3 times or add extra visits to your study without telling you without extra compensation!

He didn't fight at all for me and knew nothing about my case when we went before the judge. I have never been in need of an attorney so I found him off the internet. Biggest mistake if my life.

Worst experience I've had in a long time love Ulta but may go to sephora and pay more because customer service awful at this location. Gave me a hard time because I wanted to try it cosmetics and had no idea what to love for or shade because I normally use bareminerals.

p-9tfaYQrfz0FlvsOVDVUA,Very nice store, staff, and range. I found the RSO's to be the friendliest in town. Safe, but no attitude... Ammo was more expensive than it should be at a range, but I think the facilities provide you with an overall better experience and that costs money. Want a cheaper range... Shoot outdoors.  I find it ironic that some reviewers tout Scottsdale GC as a better value. That's a joke in my humble opinion.

TvxL21jLMnmpuU1RSfmK0g,Emily the pharmacist was a very rude person. No help at all and acted as if my sick two year old was not worth her time to help us get his prescription. horrible customer service. She wouldn't even come back to the window but didn't mind putting in her 2 cents to the other girl  about 30 ft away from the window she refused to come back and help us because she knew she was wrong to talk to us the way she did. She even flipped her name tag around so we couldn't read her name. Thank you Stephanie,2014-03-29,T4qkqXhG75zJp4FFm5bXkg

Get there and there is no car she says it will be just few minutes someone is bringing your car from different location. 45 minutes still waiting.

I am not sure if they changed their recipes when they changed their menus but my family and I were VERY disappointed. The cost of everything had gone way up, and nothing tasted like it use to.  Even the normal house salad tasted like it had fish in it.  Speaking of salad, it came after the meal was already served snd drinks were never refilled. I miss the old Outback.

It was the wrong design on the front instead of a complex picture of buzz an woody it was a space background with two buzz and woody figures placed on top( which they charged me an extra 4 dollars for).

QuybD_bJcAB2CHcpTfREYg,From the second you walk in you feel like family. The owner knows everyone who has been in before, even if its been a few months. The best hot dogs in town and damn good messy burgers too! Honestly just wish they had one in Mesa. But the drive is worth it for those perfect hot dogs with a snap! You can always tell the good places by the line out the door during lunch hour. But dont let the line scare you, they'll get your order out quick and it's still worth the wait.,2014-03-01,Gcj5jr-VA3zaAK_TG33_Ww

QuybD_bJcAB2CHcpTfREYg,Everything is made fresh. The hot dogs are brought in from the Midwest so they have that classic snap. But in my opinion, the magic is the freshly ground and cooked burgers. You can't find better quality fast food.,2017-05-11,Gcj5jr-VA3zaAK_TG33_Ww

They argued and argued with me until I had to get loud and say just make the sandwich! Ha! What lousy management and service, unreal. It just turns you off with these unprofessional actions .

-jy9BmMZY_a_2KDwJt3pkg,Well certainly can't believe all the reviews. These guys were sent by my insurance company to tow a 40 foot motorhome. Called and told me when they were going to get there and spent over an hour CAREFULLY getting the coach on the flatbed they knew exactly what they were doing and took great care in doing it. I give them a 15 on their service. Bob even called me after they delivered it to let me know all was good. Great service. Thanks again,2017-02-16,Hn30BFValvIQsjR1VJwaSA

jmdGwxLL6h-WCuRQJAR0vg,3 months in its a beautiful place to live. Awesome pool with a fire pit and cabanas. Nice people for the most part. Maria and Rachel are great. Mario and Alvarado are on top of any maintenance concerns. It's off the 101, so it's easy to get around. Apartment doesn't exactly have the upgrades you'd expect. Basic low end appliances, small sink without a sprayer. Black linoleum that rubs off on your feet. Small but comfortable porch. Very loud pool parties.

BSGy3c4voXZ5ntOi2fJwjg,I want here sometime last week and let me just say it will be my last time. The owner if I'm correct her name was Gilla was extremely rude she was short n very unfriendly i don't understand how someone could run a business and care nothing about customer service. Although the food was good it is not worth the poor people skills,2014-05-31,wpSDPdlX9ZnADxNa_x52Rg
r8Jr-7YfkhJL2nxk9lxUNg,Ok my only complain about this place is that they haven't updated their check out format, they still use the old school cash register and this is a problem when it gets busy during the weekend. I wanted to get my check split and as you can guess it was a nightmare the hosted had to ring up everything separately! I know times are hard but they should really consider investing for the customers sake, they've been in business for a long time you would think they would have u updated already,2015-05-01,wpSDPdlX9ZnADxNa_x52Rg
r8Jr-7YfkhJL2nxk9lxUNg,This is my first time coming in and the food was ok (ordered take out) I waited for my order for about 5 min not so long of a wait, however the experience I had there (with my children) was very unpleasant, I believe it was the owner (Fina) or the manger (wasn't sure) was yelling at her employee very harshly (poor girl) it made me very upset as well as my children!

flvHqBtyXSB-FP3eNJdkGg,ost floor cleaners you buy at the store are petroleum based which means there is oil in them. This means you are leaving a film of oil on you tile and in your grout lines then you walk on them and that oil attracts dirt. For porcelain Or ceramic tile you can use white vinegar @ 1\/4 cup to two gallons of hot water vinegar is a natural acid that will help cut through the dirt but will not leave a film .,2016-03-15,cIK4hs-DatwVCb2yf4sOBQ

UCp-SehlB3OTsVSR5IkX3Q,I have been going to Dr. Moon for years. There is a long wait. However, the personalized care he gives me and every other patient is well worth it. I am never rushed. There is a bit of paperwork for your first visit but that's because the Dr. reviews your entire medical history and treats any problem you may have, which I like. This is not the right office for you if you want a quick visit but if you really want to get better there isn't a more caring office.,2014-03-05,Qs9JBDT1mfYh4WOTjWAlDg

I care for my dogs and would have had no problems with the recent ear infection issue but that's not it. My problem is they never attempted to call me and inform me. My cell phone and land line phone lists all incoming phone calls. The front gals said they attempted which was not the true.,2015-09-15,lWUt8k3HP7s1hJ1KK21mgA

He's the best!!   UPDATE: After having our pool the first year the finish became dark and discolored.  Adams claim is ""The water is hard ""  they sold us the upgrade material told us what chemicals to use. Refuse to back the material.

3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw,Five stars because of their grapefruit beer with a shot for $10 deal. The shot includes anything from patron to Jameson and the grapefruit beer is super refreshing. Seems like a ghetto small spot from the outside but once you go in the back it's a nice hippie local ambience spot to chill with your buddies! Haven't tried the food but heard its great.

D_Tz_9kARDEF3SFRDO1YMA,Let me just start off by saying, I think the store is great. From the apparel to the accessories and gadgets. But I would NEVER give my business to this store in Boca Park because of the HORRIBLE customer service I received when I just went to pickup and return a job application. Stupid blonde bitch at the register was SO RUDE! I went to pick up the app and as soon as I walked in, all I got was a nasty look. No 'hello', 'welcome to Tillys', NOTHING.

4YEAuB5Ophy1pHlqaw15xQ,Unlike what RP says, they try their best to treat your sick pet even you can't afford recommended care.  I have been there twice with my cat and each time they offered me estimates and made sure I was ok with the costs.  One time I was able to do what they recommended because it wasn't too expensive but the next time I had to ask for a more conservative treatment plan because it was too expensive and they helped me out.  I am very appreciative that they are open after hours:).,2015-04-27,OxUehbJWuW7Dtq8B1maiXQ
4YEAuB5Ophy1pHlqaw15xQ,They will give you different options based on your financials. Take a breath and ask questions. R.P, I am glad that your dog pulled through.  There is no guarantee, as they have no way of knowing what exactly what's going on with your animal.  They are going to give you options for top level care,  and that care costs money. Be thankful that they were able to save your dog with what little you had.,2015-12-05,w8MQyyOQIldoJnvo4yLBcA

He just started his shift and said he was not taking songs because he was about to close, yet he sang 3 songs before I left. When your ready for a drink you can find the bartender playing one of the machines having a cold one.,2013-09-10,7S1E-KnrSu7teSofoVRhdQ

The bartenders during that time are so friendly and nice they focus on costumer and keep you wanting to come back!

BuFYIRXZNc0Ti-JSQ-QdvA,Sketchy...husband and I came here last night and all the workers were young HS kids. As my husband gave the girl his debit card, she held it and walked away from the register for a good 4 minutes. Normally when you pay at a drive thru they slide your card at the register of the drive thru first and gives the card right back. After waiting 4 minutes she returned with our blizzard and shake and proceeded to run his card at the drive thru register. Keeping an eye on our bank statement! Pay cash!,2014-12-06,5Vh1RwfsuT4WXY5o-AlF5Q

Boy was I disappointed though. I got th triple burger (no cheese, no bun), fries and a water. Dryest burger I've ever had. My toddler wouldn't even touch the fries.

WEtbc5oewinsWdhrXDcojQ,This company seems to pick and choose which customers they will tend to. The movers not only stole from me being employed for two weeks, but one was also high on drugs. Luis is refusing to call me back\/answer emails in a promptly manner. I have documentation showing that he blatantly lied & still defended himself. He doesn't believe the customer is right. DO NOT USE THIS MOVING COMPANY. DO NOT TAKE THE RISK. The movers bled on my couch and nicked my furniture. I'm still waiting on reimbursement.,2017-09-23,LKLyV4TiLqUZuiIZ6fGfow

He could have sent me the attached confirmation\/tracking order for the couch IF HE ACTUALLY ordered it. Didn't hear back from him until I continued to pursue correspondence and here's proof of his excuse\/story\/lie.,2017-09-23,LKLyV4TiLqUZuiIZ6fGfow

Specify that you need to see the optimologist. I said I needed contacts and got set up with the surgeon anyway. I had to come back a week later for my contact fitting. She is only there on certain days. Very nice people! However, I had a pretty chaotic experience. Not a place for the impatient or the inflexible schedule.,2016-05-11,tPM2gY8pWHUaQQ7CA1dhQw

When we first arrived it looked a little dead, so me and the others in my group where a little concerned. However, they made us feel welcome and at ease and put on a great show for us. If you're up for some a little different such adult clown comedy, a little singing, and hear some amature comedy acts this is a great show to see. Thank you Ray for putting on a fun and interactive show for us!,2014-01-11,DLXAsA6Kvpj8SA5_szdjWA

I couldn't get in with an actual Dr for a little over a month, and just wanted to be sure things looked ok. Unfortunately, the staff is not well-informed & isn't pro-choice. They'll have you watch unnecessary vids to scare you, or try changing your opinion on abortion whether you want one or not. Be careful.

Steak sandwich over cooked & lacked flavor deep dish pizza was ok I would order again but with very very little sauce. we ordered garlic bread received something else which we didn't know until we got the bill but was good. soda was flat. so if you will go there I say order pizza with little sauce & make sure you get what you ordered and not something else that will cost more. & don't expect the best service or quality but ok on price,2013-09-11,BybPJpxTTul7tde-PIG75A

DC3Uyai-vCCUgMmMvLESlw,I have lived in las Vegas for 19 yrs and I think the graveyard bartender Dan is one of the best local bartenders I have met in that time. I am a bartender at the flamingo and I go to eat drink and gamble after work since 2001. This guy makes you feel at home and like you are family! If it wasn't for the fluke that I stopped in on Dan's shift I would have never come back! I will definitely be back here but only on a weekend graveyard shift considering Dan will be there.,2014-05-16,3E16msdLOcarfHD4JbUBmQ

In addition, rolls were obviously made with old rice as well as dirty dishes.  Enter at your own risk.,2013-05-11,UfC5oT8bEONYqEATQ-2hlg

aS1qJzTGyluRT2tJ09Jbaw,If you already know that you want to order their Volcano kimchi fried rice (minimum order of 2 for $7.99\/order) let the hostess know ahead of time so they can set your table with a different grill. Otherwise, they have to cook all the meats first and you have to wait til the end for the fried rice. I like to eat my meats with rice. I was just a little annoyed that I had to set my meat aside for the grill change and wait for the rice to cook,2016-06-06,7U2cOebWk-KZWhrlqCBIvA

P8Rgl4h4PiGPl-HRMgilQg,My BIGGEST complaint is being subjected to Boris, the Russian, who subjects us to his pro Trump opinions. It is disguised as political analysis. Where is the opposing point of view?  News is suppose to be objective  and if opinions are given, then there should be equal time for all sides. I will not watch Sinclair unless they give equal time to opposing points of view.  They need to remember that their job is to report the news, not brainwash people.,2017-08-08,v505GHyPaCJkJrFuG_kyPg

I messed up so bad that I never thought I'd get out of the vehicle. I contacted George about my issue and he assured me he'd do his best. Today he called me with a deal he thought could help me fix it all. And he was right! I left Gaudin just a short time later with a 2017 Ford Escape!

YrU9_74Wc8AuOwYLywL97g,This store is horrible and rude to customers!!! The employees have no good customer service, most Hispanic employees. I wonder if they even have the right to work? No manager around and if you ask for one they lie and tell you he will be back tomorrow, you call and ask when can I come in and speak to him. Then they tell you a different story.

ZbQC5MCxZPg2HhrQ2VV4lw,The ""loss of use"" coverage portion of the rental insurance they try so desperately to sell you is typically a perk offered by credit card companies (if you don't pay for it with your primary car insurance company). These people will check your insurance ID card and try to prey on you if they think you don't understand the coverages. Call your credit card company to see if you have it before booking so you'll know these people are full of shit when you talk to them.,2017-09-20,fJLLB9WBJ9GabiBxhSslsg

Customer service is in the eye of the beholder.  In this case one has it.   The other will loose business for this location because it is strike 3 for me.

u6xb2aUAvX6i1WhsQWqgWg,I tried Lo lo's for the first time today. I loved it. I had the plate with 3 tenders it came with 2sides I chose a waffle and Mac and cheese. Instead of sauce for the tenders I asked for gravy which is really good. The waffle was one of the best I've ever had. The chicken was really good and the gravy made it even better the gravy was even good on the mac& cheese which was a little plain. The corn bread was very good also. I will go back again.

aDQ2LO_JsIgJt1h26eq07A,The original donuts are always fresh and delicious. If you order any other type of donut it's a crap shoot on quality\/freshness. I would not recommend their coffee, you're better off with Dunkin Donuts for that. Staff\/customer service is hit and miss, I would say average. Bottom Line: hit this place up if you are in the mood for original glazed donuts and grab your coffee somewhere else. :),2014-04-03,b2l1PEw8ndoQlxzzIgeGCg

EkuSy_kM8dpGrlb2pTxCBw,Probably the worst Korean restaurant in Vegas. Service was poor. Never served water and asked anything after the table is set. We ate bibimbaps, but they were tasteless even though we were quite hungry. I am from Korea, have stayed in US several years, and have been many Korean restaurants, but this one definitely stands out as an bad example. Don't go to this restaurant unless you don't have a car, don't have enough time to drive outside of the city, or you feel home sick so much.,2013-05-25,paL4rtc_H738qG1nrcWELA

kzbH1_l7VTSfFFcwTqY6vA,Our experience at Sarafino's last night was quite memorable. Kymberly was our server and she was not only personable and funny, but her service was prompt and thoughtful. I ordered the linguini and white clam sauce for my entree and it was absolutely delicious! My friends had veal Parmesan, and penne with barb's pomodoro sauce, which were equally adored. The only drawbacks were the gelato, which was good, but too expensive in our opinion, and the bitter coffee. Overall, we were very pleased! :),2013-07-24,YSXU_P5VV9cJTYP8BK2rTg

kUz5-7Nm-gzQAmvgvegbLg,I went to this place the other night with a friend because it was open late. The food was not bad, we ordered a sashimi platter to share and a roll or two. However we were not impressed at the 20% gratuity automatically added to our bill. We were a party of TWO, and I do not think that ""auto-gratuity"" is necessary or appropriate unless it's with a group of 4 or more. Tips should be based on SERVICE. And as a person who usually tips well, it left a bad taste in my mouth. I will not be returning.,2013-11-07,ow6f-n18NVCpnR8e4-4tOg

nO0UrzXWSzWkghUGL7fxuw,This was my first visit to Bonefish Grille. We went early evening & there was no wait. I'm not a big seafood fan, nevertheless, I tried the salmon & it was delicious. The only negatives are: the restaurant & restrooms are too dark (not enough lighting) & the waitress did not serve us any bread. I didn't know bread was served until I read the reviews online. We had to wait a good long while (25-30 mins) to get our entrees when most tables were empty.,2013-07-21,vD3SlGUpVR2lTBBIhkusAw
