BvRYdhStop6veX2SsRkqIA,and than he said it would take 15 more minutes to bring it, I was not happy about that and asked the front lady to address this and give me some sort of compensation instead she bad mouthed me and gave me a very nasty look and attitude! I have never seen such a bad service in Canada! She told me that she cant give me any sort of discount since the tilt would be short and she gotta give it out of her own pocked and claimed that the manager is not around!

I went in for an appointment to get color set in my hair all was good until I had to wait more then the 40 mins for toner to set while she went to do someone else's hair. 40 mins later she got another girl to rinse out my hair only to leave me to blow dry it myself. I've never been to a salon that makes you blow dry your own hair! The staff seemed overall friendly but lacking so much professionalism.  I wouldn't go back,2014-01-08,ieLWOFnpftgz4jkBrM2m1A

I wish I had read the other reviews before I ordered as I would have discovered that firstly, the meals are big enough for 2 people and secondly, that this place doesn't mess around with the heat!

I've been living (and drinking) here for a few years now and this is literally the first time I have ever been denied service. The steak and frites are not worth it nor the fish and chips. Service was not great. And the manager was not very friendly when I spoke to him about the ID situation.,2013-05-18,hw27LtQr9PhTmFNBuT1mIw

If this is any indication of the warmth and attention of this place, I am cancelling my reservation and taking my date somewhere friendlier. Thanks but no thanks!,2015-02-04,llEb3sDGSXjzu5TwDTm3kg

I got a gel manicure done there this afternoon and when I asked for an extra coat or made any suggestion as to what was being done to MY nails, the girl was rude and quick to tell me ""no"" and start complaining to her other coworkers in her language. She told me I could go with no hand massage and no lotion. Kim the manager is great, but that does not make up for the awful mannered girls that work for her,2014-04-12,1cIsgSf-nDXYPGN0CEx7Ow

1PQzTopufAMDpx0HHBFeRA,Small parking lot, so take transit if you can. Weekday lunch can get busy so you may want to make a reservation (they are on Open Table too). Also their jerk and hot sauces are for sale. Buy some and thank me later!,2014-10-13,Kh0cFp8G0CPAtyphCKxkiw
1PQzTopufAMDpx0HHBFeRA,Accessibility: While the building is all one level, the restaurant is not wheelchair accessible. There is a step from the parking lot\/street to the entrance. Washrooms are on same floor but are very narrow with no grab bars. People who use canes may be able to manage okay, but those who use walkers (even folding ones) may find it challenging to use the washrooms if they need their devices for leverage as the stalls are too small to accommodate.,2014-11-08,Kh0cFp8G0CPAtyphCKxkiw

Y8vH_HD8JiUXZWHecrvMPA,This place is designed for take-out and the rashers will taste better if you wait 5-10 minutes before eating them. Walk home confident in the knowledge the cooling off period will benefit the flavour. It's great that this place cooks their food so hot but I find dining in can be a teeny bit underwhelming as the rashers are so hot for so long it's hard to properly taste them. When I walk home I find the food is still piping hot, but not scorching enough to almost ruin the flavour.,2014-06-11,Oxe8DXjBOi6C-cR2w64zOg

Very rough hands, felt the comp and her fist on my face at most times. Previous history of neck strain- she pulls hair more.

All the meat either has cheese or garlic smothered on it. FYI if you put cheese and garlic on anything it will taste good.

UNlHO5PyA--hSM4SvbPGyg,How can you go wrong with fish and chips? That's what I thought when I went to reliable last night! All the hype about this place is ridiculous! My boyfriend and I both got  haddock and chips. The fish was flat, no crispness to it at all and it was tasteless. It wasn't flaky when I bit into it. The chips were soggy and limp!

VAE8gdXm7JAml0CLTs3kNA,I'm irish and I can tell you it's nothing like an Irish pub!! It's like a canteen. An old woman served me and my friend and she asked me for ID and not my friend. I'm 26 and my friend is 20. I didn't have ID with me and she wouldn't serve me. I thought it was a bit over the top as I was clearly acting mature. I wasn't acting like a giddy teen!

gecnpjuzDHNlv9C7yg-Slw,Mon\/Tues are 1\/2 price wing nights-must order a drink. Used to order anything (ie. Appetizer, other food, etc.) To get the wing deal. Seems that the drink policy is now strongly enforced. Wings used to be huge but over the last few visits, we noticed a fewer amount of wings (used to be approx 10 lrg\/lb and it is now 6-8)  but assumed it was due to weight.  However, today I ordered 2lbs and got 15 TINY wings! I used to be a strong supporter of this place, but enough is enough.,2014-11-17,KRLvdRUS9VIlsJJnsEua6g

2Y-28XrkMeeA4FFvv_73tw,I ordered a $18 dish and got a small bowl of food. Ridiculous!  Unacceptable!!  I called the restaurant, and despite them ""noticing it was small"" they decided not to do anything about it. Very unacceptable. At the end, not only did the manager not accept any concessions, but she was quite angry with my phone call and said ""don't order from us again.""  Very rude and unprofessional. We will not order food from them again and I would advise all to avoid this restaurant.,2017-08-25,Q8rW3FuFjkM3QSlGYUJ9TA

In spite of the 'no reservations' on wing nights they helped us with tips on timing so we could get all 10 of us seated together. We introduced a number of Newbies to their wings and all bar one have voted them their new faves. We are only back from Aussie for 12 nights & this is on our 'must eat' places.

I had the eggs Bennie at numerous places around Toronto and was surprised at how awful the hollandaise sauce was. I don't think it was hollandaise sauce. More like warmed yellow mayonnaise.

6mdBAB5Dg12cRuciSQqqmA,Horrible customer service. I went in to see if they would check if my glasses were the same prescription as my new prescription and they refused to check! They said they had no monetary motivation to get my glasses checked because I did not purchase those glasses from their store. I went to two other stores and they were super nice and checked my glasses and cleaned them too. If you are thinking of buying, expect that they will do nothing for you if they don't get any money for it.,2013-12-01,1yOYrd4iYaMCBnwG82WyNQ

9b4Slk4fVHYdNvB61RXUbQ,Last minute walk-in. Very negative first impression; stylist introduced herself by stating that my ends were horrible and that a  haircut was needed pronto--despite that clearly not being the case. Said stylist proceeded to bash my profession throughout the entire duration of my blow dry and did not even give me what I asked for!! I do not recommend coming here.,2015-02-11,6pDCqee5g6jFB402L15kmg

oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ,Laughable insalata grande with stale, old, wilted spinach and fake brie. A mish mash of flavors that just did not work so better fill up on bread. Tiny, bitter cappuccinos. And worst of all---their servers and service. My colleague is deathly allergic to onions and when the kitchen made a mistake and covered her dish with green onions and she questioned it, the server's reply was, ""you'll be fine.""  It left everyone aghast. There's way better spots on King West.,2015-07-31,6pDCqee5g6jFB402L15kmg

eryI97Mlqac45wti3MTqSw,Barely any Acai in my Acai bowl, and for $11+, that was kind of disappointing. I don't know why it is advertised as a bowl, and even appears so on their website when it's a paper cup. Still great tasting overall though.,2015-09-19,6pDCqee5g6jFB402L15kmg

wRKYLXr9z--kt96ELXzv1Q,Quality of food is that of a cheap, local joint. Messed up our steak order and we got it well done& burned and smothered in sauce to cover it up. Second time around still didn't taste right. This is clearly the restaurant with pre packaged frozen food. Menu & interior resembles semi-fine dining but in reality this is no better than mall food court quality and taste.

aAYl1-tsvP9Kzs7YESi8Rg,I was raised in the south. The pork ribs are called Carolina style but it's spicy and tangy so it's a little more Of a Texas\/Carolina hybrid. Delicious and tender! The fried chicken is not southern style, it's more like a gourmet version of southern style. Delicious and tender with really crispy skin but not your typical regular southern fried chicken. As delicious as the food is, the portions are small. Maybe it's because I'm not used to Toronto prices but it seemed small for the price to me.,2013-12-13,iYMTkQWgKYD9pfCH4-kFRA

vtq4qWljP-I6owRvihQNsQ,Overpriced schlock. I left my wife to grab her take out after a pitiful explanation of the menu from the ill informed girl at the register and walked over to On A Bun. Rice and potatoes were garbage, chicken was ok, but $18 for one or $36 for two dinners? I'll continue driving out to the New York Cafe on Broadview even though I'm walking distance to GRK.

_3mq1ptgCIwzaIG_P7BV3Q,Definitely not recommending this place. We went for dinner last night - I ordered the steak frites. As per the menu (and the dish itself), it comes with garlic aioli dip - which for me is what I happened to be craving. Dish came - no garlic aioli. Once the server came back around, we asked her for some. She looked puzzled - went to the kitchen and returned a minute later and told us there was none but the cook could ""make some"" but that my ""steak would get cold waiting"". Will not return.,2014-04-27,E9iFTz-0DBnysElINFwW5g

w4k-mDGUhNyJSCMK09VzdA,I've lived across from here for a while and was never sure if it was open or not. Saw their open sign illuminated tonight, came in; new owners said they just reopened. Really cheap beer; tall can of Pilsner 4.50 (cf. nearby Bambi's, at which I think they're 6.50). Also have a stage. Writing this review because the place seems cool and I want them to stay open so I can get cheap beer close to me (and also the owners seem nice). + debit machine; needn't dole doll hairs on atm withdrawals.,2014-01-27,37HRrt9Rl-ATmWgG0UBxCA

ZN7tdU8tgklVNYH0vWHIsA,Stacey Pollak, is Toronto's best kept secret for getting juicy, butter blond highlights. My hair was transformed to look rich but not brassy and natural looking with just enough buzz that makes you feel glam. Her highlights made my hair even healthier than when I first came in 3 yrs ago. It now looks more full, shiny and luscious and I get compliments on it even two months from when I get it done. She is a legit hair doctor and is worth every penny.  - Mila Godiva,2013-03-23,_r3F0uruX5ZH9UPN2HtRyA

fEn2IwdSrejzHebfUzWDMg,Hmv is closing end of April.  I'm not surprised with the worst  customer service ever.  The customer service was always poor.  Head office being the worst.  Sunrise will be around.  The pure hmv points was shady.  I'd get points,  can't use them,  not enough,  then it would expire and you need to pay $3.00.

I don't go there all the time.  Once in a while when I don't have time to cook.  Ritz is the same. Very skimpy portions. Might as well just get a small but their small will be tiny. :),2016-12-14,RI-tf9iGOux81GjnB5Qt_Q

This was very confusing to me. They are out of ramen? They are out of rice? The waitress could not give me a straight answer and apparently the owner was in the washroom or something. I've always defended this place and loved it, but this really annoyed me. It seemed like they were just trying to get me to pay full price.,2016-03-15,xR8prW7h0ZvtE_PCwPqKBw

VjQO_Q_iAQ7Y4eXgySDbmw,he staff here do not give proper receipts or calculation of services. They make it up and none of your costs will add up! I knew something was wrong when I got a supposed 10% discount , but still had to pay 230$ for a dye job with no cut, nothing else. In the end when I kept asking how they could estimate 160$ for the whole thing when its 230$, they said it was because of the mandatory tip included ........... w.t.f hahaha,2013-04-04,eCW7WW3n_0FoAtPRbT_qXA

9HWdRtNS0q4_UkEvL14IfA,I went to this restaurant this evening and just as I was about to sit down, I decided to leave. Why? Because the restaurant smelled like someone was smoking cigarettes.

DE89UdHFMCN6DtYWZuer5A,People, if you want a tasty broth, DO NOT get the shoyu based broth. It's usually the lightest, hence not much flavor. So before saying that the ramen is bland, make sure you taste their specialty before passing judgement.

0hudPyuCBlKg79OwKBw-eQ,Every time I've been here, the service has been HORRIBLE. Yesterday I waited for a half hour on the patio before anyone even brought us MENUS. I ended up going into the bar to order a round of drinks myself. After we finally got menus, it was another half hour of pestering the overworked and understaffed waitresses for service before anyone even took our order. Add another half hour to that, and they only brought out three of the four (simple) dishes we ordered. Awful, over priced, waste of time,2013-05-21,VamOFXYsxeRE33q42mKv9g

-L88B-PrtzwujhLuYc2k_g,Everything was great until they brought the bill.  First they forgot to apply our coupon for ""up to $20 off"" then when they did, they only gave us $16 off because one of the 4 entrée's was less than $20.  Even though we had 2 meals over $20 the waitress AND manager argued with us and gave us MAJOR attitude.   Finally we had them split the bill to have the 2 entrees over $20 on one bill for them to give us the proper discount.  It's not the $4, it's the principle and the way it was handled.,2013-09-02,gLM2CrIAm5WP7viKCJKstg

JH3zKlfslbSVeA_KsAaRRQ,Just finished a disappointing service and meal. After coming  here once a year for years, something didn't add up. The staff were less attentive than before with less energy and waiter was defensive to any feedback we provided when he asked. Found out from the bus boy new ownership took over in Nov 2014. Food was boring, presentation odd, and dessert was a pile of blue cheese on a plate. I'd pay anyone money to see if they could finish it.

E_Qr3fQrZCwOvEnEDYT4Kw,Attended as a guest of a member for dinner and drinks with friends. Loved the convenience and privacy. The bartenders produced the best Manhatten I've ever had, and the attention to detail behind the bar was apparent in the use of fresh fruit and presentation. The food did not blow my socks off but the menu offerings were diverse and interesting. The service was fabulous. While the overall vibe was non-pretentious it is the service that separates this private club above a regular venue.,2015-11-02,TdGYEjTQLgv4SFwDulWtsw

gcec09O3lhUrzqXNJq0QVQ,Karbouzi is by far the best Greek restaurant in this area. High quality ingredients prepared properly. The way they form the chicken around the skewer (large souvlaki dinner) keeps it really moist. Its unique, I had not seen it before. It's slightly more expensive (i.e.pita is extra) then the typical fast Greek restaurant is. But when your craving some Greek comfort food it's well worth it. I have not been to any other Greek restaurant since I found this little gem on orderit.ca.,2013-06-13,2f3gd7XEmJgQZyx9vr5pfA

It's alright if you want to bond with your friends. I definitely wouldn't find it relaxing solo. I find it grossly communal. Not my idea of a good time. I'd rather spend my money somewhere classier and more tranquil. I won't let anyone drag me back there.,2017-04-13,r_hz3sTYmG0oJSSq4SOw3A
gmGHRByX_Z1iJenUuaW0kw,I won't go back. I inquired ahead as to whether there would be Christmas music because I wanted to escape from the Christmas world. I was assured there wouldn't be any. The day of my appt. Xmas music played in the change room & common areas. After the fact I was sent a feedback form via email, I mentioned my disappointment & instead of a follow up reply, I was put on the spam list, it insulted me that they cared more about marketing than customer care.,2017-04-13,r_hz3sTYmG0oJSSq4SOw3A

We noticed the large crowd around Buster's and figured it must be a hit here so we chose to hop on the bandwagon. We each ordered a Halibut on a bun and an additional gumbo.

TBH I think sushi bong sushi rolls are better than this. I would rather go to jabistro (pay 10% more to eat something that's worth the price). I don't recommend this place at all. ALSO, they need better staff. They dropped the plates like 3 times in an hour...it was a very unpleasant experience.,2017-06-30,HSk8-9dYnLJH6vqy0UJXMA

Great and useless info, but thanks for sharing,2013-05-06,xQfMuSSSHlmdV5hH-f4bbA

5NaYJD-LSwHhGRHuMFZ1fQ,Gas is generally cheaper than other shell stations. However, there is plenty of rage from the motorists. Another thing is to avoid the car wash. The gentleman running it seems to be an angry man. I went to use the car wash and it stopped working.

bhqOSajw2x1NLQxijsDVcg, tried Home Of the Brave for the first time last night and I am DISGUSTED by the service. As someone who works in the industry I know very well how to treat guests. It's sad because the restaurant was immaculate, beautiful decor, a very large bar and a great atmosphere. My server Matt was downright disrespectful. 15 minutes after being seated we placed our combined drink and food order. Once we received our beers he proceeded to call us ""kids"" (my boyfriend is 28 and I'm 24).  (Pt.2 --),2014-02-25,kPRM3DWjpWIwguX1e0d2Qg

Q3SdFs_6P3BPhPPywHZqBQ,Hm maybe we ordered the wrong things. I got the pad thai and my boyfriend got a beef and broccoli chow mein. Neither of us were happy with our meals. I didn't like the taste of their pad thai and the chow mein was just really greasy. It wasn't that cheap either for this type of food and especially considering the location.,2016-04-22,7D3HbzsPMXn7AER3NmM2pA
rHxc9sR5ELjboLqd_fUzJg,Really yummy! Had the mussels, ragu and shrimp linguini. All were great! Didn't receive the same level of service that others have mentioned though. Not sure why? Maybe they're catering to an older demographic? My boyfriend and I are both in our 20s and were the youngest people there on a Saturday night. All other tables were 40+. I would go back though, really yummy food and they're usually not busy so no wait :),2016-06-05,7D3HbzsPMXn7AER3NmM2pA

aimw2Ha_bxJfTTSsCnIgLw,INCONSISTENT is how I would describe Duffy's. They are always in and out of kitchen staff. Sometimes the mac and cheese is amazing, other times it tastes like cat vomit sprinkled with cardboard. Music on thursdays is quite good, but weekend rock shows are filled with under aged kids and it is hard on the hearing of anyone older than 30. Especially when trying to have a relaxing pub dinner at 7:30pm.,2014-07-22,4nqyfQvpTMk6n5r0LzCzVw
aimw2Ha_bxJfTTSsCnIgLw,There never seems to be security at their events. Even at thrasher shows. I have witnessed at least two fights, and have since stopped giving this establishment my money.
